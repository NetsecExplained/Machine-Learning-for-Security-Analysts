Dear Friend,Dear Friend, 
   My name is Mr. Paul Patterson,Regional Head of British 
Isles 
(Royal Bank of Canada Investment Management (UK) Limited). I am 
writing in respect of a German British citizen customer of my bank Mr.
Akotuah S.T who died together with his wife and children in a Plan 
crash on Monday 31st july 2000 while they were flying to New York on 
vacation. 
    The late Mr. Akotuah S. E left in our bank the sum of 
twenty five million five hundred thousand pounds (25.5 million pounds) 
and nobody will ever come for this money because he died with his 
entire family. I am the only person that is aware of this money since 
Mr. Akotuah S. E did not give to my bank any next of kin to inherit his 
money. Now, I want to use my position in the bank to transfer this 
money to your country for investment.If you can provide me with an 
account where I can transfer this (twenty five million five hundred 
thousand pounds) I will give you 40% of this entire fund while the 
remaining 50% shall be for me, extra 10% will be for transfer charges. 
I am hoping to get a favourable response from you. 
MR. PAUL PATTERSON
