The 
Government of India has recently mandated the Conditional
Access System for 
distribution of satellite television channels. This has
created a whole new 
marketplace in the Indian cable industry. Once this bill is
made an act, it will 
be mandatory for cable operators to distribute pay channels
through a set-top 
box.India has an estimated 38
million cable homes! The 
implementation of this change will require massive
investments in set-top boxes, 
conditional access software and the upgradation of headend
networks - a great 
oppotunity for you to tap this huge market!! Exhibiting your
products at the 
11th Convergence India exhibition will give you an
opportunity to meet 
all your  targetted visitors under a
single 
roof.Other
exhibits will be from 
various industries including high speed networking, internet
telephony, mobile 
and satellite communications, network infrastructure, optical
access networking, 
portable communication devices, t&m and interactive
media, VoIP, wireless 
access, 3G, m-commerce, multimedia broadband services via
satellite, conditional 
access technologies, satellite receivers and transmitters,
encoders, decoders, 
and the latest in broadcast, cable and satellite
equipment, mobile phone 
accesories  etc.We 
successfully concluded the 10th Convergence
India 2002
