5 Ways to Create a Unique Website
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. This is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. These
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.

1. Navigation System

Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase 
(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list 
of categories on the left, and information about the network 
on the top bar.

It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:

- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.

2. Color Scheme

When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white.

A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer
(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron
Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles 
(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),
or Download.com (http://www.download.com) for "color schemer."

3. Content Window

This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.

Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what 
you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.

To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be
careful though. Do not use too much content from other 
authors, as mentioned above.

4. Font(s)

Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)

Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be 
used for long pieces of text.

The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.

5. Advertising

Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing 
that almost every website has. The most common type is what 
is known as "banner" advertising. It is called that because it is 
long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The 
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.

New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new
style called "skyscraper" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)

Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners 
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.

    Conclusion

These are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know what 
you find that helps you create a unique website. My email 
address is mailto:corbb@justforwebmasters.com.
