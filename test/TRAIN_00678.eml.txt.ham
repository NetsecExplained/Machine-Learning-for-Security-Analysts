Wouldn't it be better if the syntax was this:

update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-www-browser
x-www-browser /opt/firefox/firefox 3

Of course, this would be making use of /opt for what it was
originally intended, for all the software and add-on packages that are
not part of the default installation.
