It could also be due to the browser not copying certain characters
correctly to the clipboard.

Let's start at the beginning, which output do you get from this command:

  locale

If you use an utf8-based locale, e.g. "en_US.UTF-8", then the following
command should print the numbers 1-5 in superscript:

  echo -e "\xc2\xb9\xc2\xb2\xc2\xb3\xe2\x81\xb4\xe2\x81\xb5"

What do you get?

If the locale is set up correctly and your terminal supports the
characters, then the easiest method is to define a compose key and use
 + "^" + "2". (The "+" means pressing the keys in sequence,
releasing each key before pressing the next one.)
