Configuration errors using tor, privoxy & polipoDear all

On an up-to-date testing machine, I am using Iceweasel + tor + privoxy.  
Florian helped me with an issue like this sometime back, but revisiting 
his helpful advice has not helped on this occasion.

The situation is as follows:

Using Iceweasel, I enable the tor button and receive a warning message 
"Tor proxy test: local HTTP proxy is unreachable. Is polipo running 
properly?"

Well, no because polipo wasn't installed - why and when this suddenly 
became a necessity I don't know, but anyway I installed polipo and 
configured it according to the tutorial on 
http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polipo which, in my circumstances, 
required me to uncomment this line in the config file:

         socksParentProxy = localhost:9050

Having restarted the daemons, and still getting the same error and no 
connection, I pointed the browser at privoxy as per the polipo 
configuration page referred to above, in the preferences/ network 
settings tab, and in the polipo config file, I uncommented the line:

         socksParentProxy = localhost:9050

I then restarted polipo, double-checked the privoxy config file to 
ensure that forwarding was still set as required and restarted the tor 
and privoxy daemons.  However, I still get the same error messages 
(basically cannot connect to web-pages) and the tor test gives the same 
results as before.

 From researching this on the web, I am unable to ascertain whether or 
not I even need polipo, but the preferences settings tab for the tor 
button have a check-box for using polipo, so it appears as if tor is now 
expecting polipo to be installed and running as default.  But, I have 
now reached the limit of what I know what to do or can figure out.  I am 
also conscious of the risk of screwing things up further in an effort to 
fix this, so before proceeding further would like to ask this list for 
help and advice.

I appreciate any thoughts/ ideas.

Thanks

AG
