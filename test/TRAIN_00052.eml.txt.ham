Installation on HP T5700 from USB; partitioningHello everyone!

According to this tutorial (http://d-i.pascal.at/) I was able to start 
the installation process from USB stick on my:

HP 5700 Thin Client Terminal
1 GHz Processor
512 RAM
256 internal flash drive

But I get stuck because there is not enough space even for minimal 
installation (netinstall.iso).
Now the question:

I have also another 4GB USB stick. Can I Install the biggest parts of 
the system on it?
If yes, which parts of the filesystem do I need place on internal flash 
memory (IDE ATA, faster), and
which on the USB stick?

The device will be used as a FTP, NAS etc.

Thanks on advance
Krzysztof
