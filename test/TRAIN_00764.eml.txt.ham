Dear readers,

It was a crushing blow to discover that Vindigo, my
all-time-favorite Palm app, was no longer free. Twenty-five bucks
wasn't steep, but the principle of paying for a former freebie
was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though; surprising
myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd
rather dish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.

That's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on. Now that
most of us have gotten sucked in by those gratis Web e-mail
accounts, most "free" Web e-mailers have started charging for
premium services or imposing strict limitations on free accounts.
Read our reviews 
of the four top services to see what you get if
you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you want
to stay spam-free.

Surfacing on this week's Buzz Meter is another free-gone-fee app.
The latest version of the popular file-sharing software BearShare
now offers a paid version that lets you search and download
without those annoying ads. Maybe the best things in life are now
those with a fee.

CNET reviews four no-cost Web e-mailers
Yahoo now charges for services that were once free; Hotmail
   dumps accounts without so much as an explanation. So-called
   free Web-based e-mailers aren't quite as free-wheelin' as they
   once were. Are the savings worth the hassle? We take another
   look at "free" e-mailers.

Gifts for grads: home entertainment

  Fixing up that first apartment can be a trying time for a
   young grad. Make it easy by throwing in some home-theater
   equipment along with the congratulations. Combining a DVD
   player with a solid speaker system, the Onkyo HTS-L5 is the
   perfect all-in-one-device. Also on tap: portable DVD players,
   the best TiVo player we found, and a 27-inch HD-ready TV set
   that's perfect for the smart set.

 WorldCom woes continue




WorldCom woes dominate, BearShare 4.0 isn't what it used to be,
and Jaguar runs ahead of schedule.

--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends


1
WorldCom:
I hate to put it first, but unfortunately, all other
   tech trends are overshadowed by this scandal. Now entering its
   fourth week as front-page news, WorldCom woes continue to sap
   investor confidence. This week's big story: the top execs from
   the company are standing silent against government accusations
   of wrongdoing.


2
BearShare 4.0:
This new version of the well-known peer-to-peer
   software was been completely redesigned and comes in two
   flavors: free with ads and paid without ads. This is nice
   touch, but unfortunately, 4.0 fails in one key area:
   downloading music. It uses the Gnutella client, but in CNET's
   tests, it had an abysmal success rate at actually returning
   files.

3
Jaguar:
  Who ever heard of an operating system release being
   early? Well, Apple is managing to pull off the impossible; it
   intends to ship an update to OS X in August, instead of the
   anticipated late fall time frame.   

4
Warcraft III:
Ah, summer: the perfect time to stay inside and
   sit in front of your computer. Warcraft III has just been
   released--right in time for the good weather. GameSpot calls
   it one the finest games ever made, but if that doesn't do it
   for you, there's another fighting game on deck (see No. 5).

5
America's Army: As Senior Editor Darren Gladstone pointed out in a recent column, the Army wants you to play PC games.
   That's right: the United States Army spent $6.3 million
   developing its own title, and it has just launched a television
   campaign to drum up interest. Apparently, the campaign is
   working, since CNET users made America's Army a top search
   term last week.
