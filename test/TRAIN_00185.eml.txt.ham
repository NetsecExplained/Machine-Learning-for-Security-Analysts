Please forgive me if my choice of words offended you.  That wasn't my
intention at all.  I was speaking figuratively, not literally.  My point was
that swapping out the production switch, which probably has others users
plugged in, shouldn't be the first troubleshooting step, especially if it's
a managed switch and can thus show per port configuration and traffic data.

This data usually shines a bight light on these types of issues.  Usually
the problem in cases like the OP is having relate to VLAN configuration.  On
manyy/most managed switches which have global VLANs already configured, but
not all ports configured, if you plug a PC into an unconfigured port the PC
sees a dead network.  The solution is to add that port to one or more
appropriate VLANs.
