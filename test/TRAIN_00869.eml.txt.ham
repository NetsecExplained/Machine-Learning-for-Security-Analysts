When doing startx as a normal user from console I get some errors like "xkb
could not initialize" and "Xinit: no such file or directory" and "Xinit:
Could not connect to xserver"....

Some friend told me to purge kde and reinstall it. I don't think this will
help. Do you think I should give it a try?
