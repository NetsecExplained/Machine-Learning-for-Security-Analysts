KMail doesn't use Akonadi at all in KDE 4.4. It might use Akonadi in KDE=20
4.5. The only thing using Akonadi by default in KDE 4.4 is the new=20
KAddressBook. AFAIK.

So KDE 4.5 might even be more problematic in the beginning. Especially=20
when I remember the roughnesses of KDE 4.3.0 and KDE 4.4.0 I do not=20
suggest to ship a .0 or even .1 release of KDE. Even KDE 4.4.2 had quite=20
some bugs that KDE 4.4.3 fixed.

So shipping KDE 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 oder 4.4.5 IMHO could well be a better=20
option that to ship KDE 4.5.0 with Debian Squeeze.

Sadly I have not seen any KDE 4.x.0 release yet thats really suitable for=20
Debian Stable.

Ciao,
