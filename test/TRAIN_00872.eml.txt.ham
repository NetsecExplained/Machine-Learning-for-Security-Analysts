Sometimes I'll get "mount: no medium found on /dev/sr0" or it will mount, or
it will give me the other error message I posted.

I just put a disc in, tried to mount it three times, and got three different
results. Now it is mounted and /dev looks like
http://paste.debian.net/73572/

Now I've taken the disc out and dev looks like:
http://paste.debian.net/73573/

They look the same to me.
