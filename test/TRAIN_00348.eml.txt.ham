It is based on the fact that the 'official installer' overwrites files
belonging to debian packages.  When those packages someday get upgraded,
they overwrite what the nvidia driver installed, and then things break.
I have helped enough people fix that kind of mess to know.

Just a simple fact.  Overwriting packages owned by a package is always
a bad idea no matter how it is done, because someday the package will
overwrite it back on you.

linux-image-2.6-X is not updated right away unfortunately in the case
of unstable (and sometimes testing).  It should always be up to date in
stable though.  I have never quite figured out how the kernel packagers
decide when to update it.

It simply comes down to the fact that using the nvidia installer
overwrites packaged files and that is "A bad thing"(tm).

Well I am thinking of trying to come up with a method that actually makes
it try to compile the module if it is missing at boot.  My wife thought
it was rather unfriendly that her last upgrade (which gave her a new
kernel) took away X.  Sure recompiling the module with module-assistant
was easy, but it had to be done manually.  I will see if I can't find
a way to automate that for those users that want it.

Sometimes it does. :)

Also the nvidia installer for a long time hasn't worked with debian's
2.6.29 and higher kernels because they are now kbuild only (and hence
don't allow compiler tests that the nvidia installer used to work unless
they get converted to kbuild).  I am not sure if it works with it yet.
Those running their own kernels would of course never notice that problem
since they have the full sources installed the way the nvidia makefiles
assumed it would be.  This same kernel header change also turned vmware
modules into a nightmare as well as a few other out of kernel drivers.
