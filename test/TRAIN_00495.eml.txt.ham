Brightness OSD in SqueezeHi,

I am running up-to-date squeeze on a Dell Latitude D420. I have a
trivial problem, but such things bother me :-)

The hotkeys for volume and brightness adjustment work out of the box in a
GNOME session. However, when I adjust the volume using the hotkeys, I see
a nice translucent on-screen display of the volume level. This is not
the case for brightness control.

Interestingly, I briefly installed KDE a couple of days ago. I then
found that, *during a GNOME session*, the brightness OSD did appear. It
vanished again after I removed KDE.

So, the KDE installation seemed to pull in some package which is
responsible for the brightness OSD. Any idea which of the dozens of
packages it might be?
