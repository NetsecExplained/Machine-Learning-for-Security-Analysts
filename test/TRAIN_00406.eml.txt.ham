You only need to edit /etc/default/grub and run update-grub in order
to modify /boot/grub/grub.cfg (theoretically; unfortunately, you have
to edit /etc/grub.d/10_linux or /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober to change the
default generation of the menu entry names or prevent os-prober from
picking up a windows recovery partition),

The squeeze and sid kernels set the graphic mode through Kernel-based
Mode Setting (KMS). I only use headless and Xless boxes so I have not
looked into whether the kernel uses grub2's GRUB_GFXMODE OR
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX variables to set the video mode. KMS can be
turned off in grub.cfg with either "nomodeset" (possibly superceded)
or ".modeset=0" where video=i915|i945|nouveau|radeon... but I
have only gleaned this from reading Fedora and Ubuntu stuff.
