Almost all NICs load firmware blobs.  It's in dmesg somewhere.  When the
firmware doesn't load you get something like this in dmesg:

eth1: RTL8168d/8111d at 0xffffc90000c4e000,xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, XID 083000c0
IRQ 32
eth1: unable to apply firmware patch

That's a paste from one of the OPs here who was bitten by the 2.6.32-trunk
upgrade which IIRC is the one that ripped out the RTL firmware blob.

I can't find via Google a dmesg snippet of a successful RTL firmware load.
Here's what it looks like for Intel 8255X using the e100 driver, with the
firmware blobs all compiled into the kernel:

e100 0000:00:0d.0: firmware: using built-in firmware e100/d101m_ucode.bin

"built-in" signifies that the firmware blob has been included in the kernel
at compile time.  I do this to avoid issues such as this RTL problem.  It
only adds a couple hundred K to the kernel image.  And I use the vanilla
kernel.org sources to avoid any Debian "non-free" issues.

Just about every NIC on the planet uses a firmware blob.  There are, IIRC, 3
ways to load the device firmware into the Linux kernel.  This applies to all
devices that require soft firmware, not just NICs:

1.  Compile all device firmware blobs into the kernel
2.  Compile the individual blob into the driver, use initrd
3.  Put firmware file in root filesystem, tell kernel the path

#3 won't work with drivers that are needed during the boot process such as
block device drivers.  Those require method 1 or 2.  NICs should be able to
use 1-3.

There are 3 different dmesg statements and 3 different errors depending on
which method 1-3 above that you're using.

Yeah, I just pulled the mails.  One upgraded to 2.6.32-trunk on his
firewall, bricking it until he disabled the onboard RTL and installed an
Intel e100 IIRC.  They thought it was a udev issue til I noticed the
firmware load failure message referenced up above in this email.  The other
had an RTL wireless that failed for the same reason.  I can't recall how
they fixed that one.  IIRC the OP didn't swap hardware to achieve the fix,
so they did something with the kernel/driver/firmware.

Do some FTP or SCP tests back and forth to another LAN machine and see what
transfers rates you get out of that RTL chip.  I bet you get 1/3rd wire
speed at best, about 30MB/s, if even that.  The machines themselves need to
be modern to saturate the link--no slow CPUs or disks.  Any ~2GHz CPU with
512MB RAM and a decent 7.2K RPM SATA disk should be able to push/pull 50MB/s
across the wire.  For that matter, eliminate the disk by creating a 200MB
RAM disk on each machine.  Create a test file with dd and FTP/SCP it back
and forth between the RAM disks.  If your RTL chip can peak the wire it'll
be a 2-3 second transfer if your network chips and Linux TCP stacks are up
to the task.

It's looking like the RTL firmware blob issue may have been limited to the
trunk kernel.  You may get lucky.  Then again, if you roll your own and put
the firmware blobs in the kernel itself as I do, you shouldn't have a
problem.  That is, if the Debian kernel source doesn't have the blob ripped
out for being "non-free".

You mentioned you had problems building 2.6.32 and .33 kernel source.  Do
you use the Debian kernel source or kernel.org source?  I've been using the
kernel.org source for quite some time and have never had any real problems
with it (knocks on wood).  I had a build problem with .33 a while back but
that turned out to be due to a slight bit too much overclock on my machine
in this warmer weather.  ;)
