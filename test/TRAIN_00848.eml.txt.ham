I will not be reading my mail for a while -- in fact, I will be reading my mail
very intermittently until June, as I'm travelling around the world.
Your mail regarding "Immediately Attract Women          .                PVWPJ" will be read at that point.

If you're writing about something NetNote-related, please contact Nicola
McDonnell .  

SpamAssassin-related contact should be directed to the SpamAssassin-talk
mailing list , or to Craig Hughes
.

Sitescooper-related mail should go to .
WebMake-related stuff goes to, you guessed it,  ;)

I will (probably) read your mail eventually... but it will take a while.
See you in June!
