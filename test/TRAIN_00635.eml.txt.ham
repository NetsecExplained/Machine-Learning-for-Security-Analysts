If it weren't for the live migration requirement, I read this to say that
Google would be using XFS due to its superior performance:

"In a mailing list post, Google engineer Michael Rubin provided more insight
into the decision-making process that led the company to adopt Ext4. The
filesystem offered significant performance advantages over Ext2 _and nearly
rivaled the high-performance XFS filesystem_ during the company's tests.
Ext4 was ultimately chosen over XFS because it would allow Google to do a
live in-place upgrade of its existing Ext2 filesystems."
