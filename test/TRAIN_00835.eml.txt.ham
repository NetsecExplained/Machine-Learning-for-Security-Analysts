Ah ... so they ARE coming for your porn next ...

    ... CNN reported earlier this year that al Qaeda has used at least one
    Web site to post information and keeps changing the site's address to
    stay ahead of investigators.

    Authorities also are investigating information from detainees that
    suggests al Qaeda members -- and possibly even bin Laden -- are hiding
    messages inside photographic files on pornographic Web sites.

Any wagers that this heralds the appearance of a bill to ban and/or
harrass any sites which may be host to suspected-AlQaeda messages?

And what about Emenem records played backwards?
