Re: Servlets, JSP, EL and deprecated HTML attributesThis is slightly off-topic, as nothing about this is Apple-specific...=20=


But anyway: I think you are wrong. The "name" attribute is only =
deprecated for certain elements, where "id" is a better match. It's =
still the correct way to name "input", "textarea", "button" and other =
form-elements (controls). See: =
