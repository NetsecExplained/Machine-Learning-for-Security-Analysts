Those hours of the night were precious, but Fremont did not use them. Defeated, he held back, magnifying the numbers of his enemy, fearing that Jackson was in front of him with his whole army, and once more out of touch with his ally, Shields. 
I did not ring. What made you come in without orders? Go away, Suzette. 

Gale turned his eyes down-stream to the barracks, and noted that the long flag-staff had at last been erected. Even as he looked he saw a bundle mounting towards its tip, and then beheld the Stars and Stripes flutter out in the air, while the men below cheered noisily. It was some time before he answered. I'm not afraid, if that's all, she answered in a very firm tone. I love you, and I trust you, and I could follow you to the world's end--or, if needful, out of it. But there's one other question. Bertram, ought I to?   I 've had a regularly splendid time, and thank you ever so much, she said when the good-nights were being exchanged..Who knows? He was, perhaps, a savage.

It was she, with her youthful zeal, who inspired Mr. Grayson and his friends with courage for a conflict against odds. He consulted her daily about his speeches; it was she who always put into them some happy thought, some telling phrase that was sure to captivate the people.
