This is true. Even if you don't see the box, moving the mouse over its 
invisible border shows corresponding events.

Looks like a bug, but not in xev, because running xev via ssh on a 
remote machine doesn't show the box either. I am running standard SL 
10.6.3 X11 "XQuartz 2.3.5 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple53)".
