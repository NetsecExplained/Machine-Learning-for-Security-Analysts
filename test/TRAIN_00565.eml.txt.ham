Yes, in stable, it's a mix between hal/udev and desktop environment mount 
system.

I suppose Debian follows FHS ("/media" for removable devices and "/mnt" for 
temporarily mount points) :-?

On GNOME yes, users can mount/umount their own usb devices via Nautilus.

It should be automatically mounted anywhere under "/media" as AKAIK, that 
is the default action for removable storage.

You will need a bit of scripting to achieve this.

There must be some pre-made applications to get that but you can also try 
to get it done with udev rules. A quick example, courtesy of Google:

You can use /media, and as Boyd already suggested, give the device a 
label to get a static name so it always get mounted under the 
same path, i.e., "/media/mygps".
