Re: What needs to improve in KDE 4?At this moment, for me, kaddressbook?  Akonadi did not  get configured right, I 
had to follow this advice to get it to start working:

Having done that yesterday I noticed that the concept of contact categories is 
missing.  Today I found that I only get empty dialogs when I attempt to edit a 
contact!  So for me kaddressbook is unstable.
