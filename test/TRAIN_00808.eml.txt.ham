Tech stocks drop again on Qwest criminal probe news
Word telecom Qwest Communications International is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office in Denver helped send technology shares lower Wednesday.

Despite a Merrill Lynch upgrade of Cisco Systems and the fact that J.P. Morgan began coverage on AOL Time Warner with a "buy" rating, CNET's Tech index fell 26.23 points, or 2.66 percent, to 965.29. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 35.11 points, or 2.54 percent, to 1,346.01--a multi-year low.

Broader markets also shed value, dragged down in part by a troubled pharmaceutical sector. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 282.5 points, or 3.11 percent, to 8,813.5, and the S&P; 500 slid 32.36 points, or 3.52 percent, to 920.47--also a multi-year low.

Banc of America Securities lowers estimates and price target on IBM in notes 7/10/02 
Analyst Joel Wagonfeld argues the computer giant is not immune to the persistent, widespread weakness in IT spending. But a roughly 6 percent dip in revenues during the second quarter will be offset by the elimination of losses from the discontinued hard disk drive business, Wagonfeld predicts. In IBM's second-quarter results, he expects continued weakness in hardware but relative strength in software and outsourcing. The company's decision to exit or restructure unprofitable, commodity businesses is sound, Wagonfeld says. He reiterates a "buy" rating on IBM.INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 68.76 -1.31%
