Re: Dual Monitors Twin View on NvidiaOne possible solution is using the "nvidia-settings"-Tool.
You can configure your display-settings in a GUI and save it  
permanently to an xorg file.
I'm using this method since years and it works very well and flawlessly.

> Hi,

> (sorry want to experiment with CUDA so non-free wasn't an option). However,
> I've just bought a new 1080p TV and connected it to the computer via HDMI.
> This unfortunately has permanently knocked the resolution down on the

> I think I'd like the monitor to be either 1280x960, 1152x864, 1024x768 and
