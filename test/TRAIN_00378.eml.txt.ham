I create my PDFs (required for Reports and Specs) with OpenOffice 

No, not the PDF stuff is  but OOo which is  crap.  Switching  from
M$ Office to OpenOffice let you  increase  the  Psy-Bill  more,  than  a
dedicated computer with M$ Viasco plus Adobe Acrobat will cost.  Even if
you ONLY create PDFs with it.

Thanks, Greetings and nice Day/Evening
