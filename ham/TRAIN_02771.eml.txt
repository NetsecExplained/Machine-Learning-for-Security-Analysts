Yes, that seems to what was happening. I have remove the PCI-E card and
the machine was able to detect the onboard VGA chipset (using module
radeonhd).

At the moment, when I boot, I get 1024x768 resolution on both of them
(monitor and TV) with both showing the same image. I have tried to
create an xorg.conf using
http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12 but it is not being
applied (both outputs have 1024x768 resolution even though I have
specified the preferred resolution in xorg.con). Does anyone see obvious
mistakes in the file or if I have missed something?

Thanks,
KS.
PS: I just realized that I could have used a DVD-HDMI adapter for my
Nvidia 8600GTS card too. However, its fan is really noisy :(
