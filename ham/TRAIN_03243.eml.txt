Techs gain on Intel, Motorola news
Although computer chip titan Intel posted lower-than-expected earnings, its upbeat forecast helped lift technology shares Wednesday.

Also boosting the sector was Motorola, which beat expectations for operating earnings and predicted a net profit in the last two quarters of the year. CNET's Tech index rose 14.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,007.37, and the tech-laced Nasdaq composite index tacked on 21.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,397.23.

With aircraft maker Boeing beating the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate, the Dow Jones industrials increased 69.37 points, or 0.82 percent, to 8,542.48. The S&P; 500 rose 5.08 points, or 0.56 percent, to 906.02.














Motorola Sees Profit Rebound 
CHICAGO - Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. on Wednesday said it expects to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by aggressive cost cutting.

Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215 million related to previously announced restructuring actions.

The world's second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.

Apple meets lowered expectations 
Apple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched analysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools fell short of the company's initial hopes.
The company earned $32 million, or 9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48 billion

Analysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share, according to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6 billion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents per share.

APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49% 

HP, EMC storage systems to work better together 
SAN FRANCISCO - Hewlett-Packard Co. and EMC Corp. said on Wednesday that they were opening up technology to each other in order to maker their storage systems work better together.

However, the deal will not include technology from Hitachi Data Systems, which makes the hardware for HP's high-end storage system, an HP spokesman said.

The deal follows close cooperation between storage heavyweight EMC and Compaq Computer Corp., which was acquired by HP in May.

Investec Inc. stays bullish on Intel in report 7/17/02 
Analysts Eric Ross and Sam Chang reiterate a "strong buy" rating on the computer chip giant after it reports second-quarter earnings below the consensus Wall Street estimate. Ross and Chang expect a modest seasonal increase in demand in the second half of this year, with strength in consumer laptop buying. Calling Intel the premier semiconductor firm, they suggest the stock is a bargain.
