Look at his e-mail address :-/

This won't be the first time I see problems with user coming from some 
restrictive networks.

There is still another option: "d) Other" :-)

Many cuban users are not able to browse the web (they have Internet but 
only e-mail access, no web browsing) so if that is the case, he cannot 
review the mailing list posts using web archives and if he is not 
receiving e-mails coming from external users (non *.cu addresses), he is 
then stuck.

But I'm just guessing, true is that in the Spanish mailing list there are 
some posts coming from him, but *not* replies.
