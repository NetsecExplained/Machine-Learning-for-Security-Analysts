Woah ;) did you tweak some flags yourself, like default rpm flags ? What 
dist are you running ? I don't think there's an athalon-redhat-linux 
machine as standard ;) it should be some permutation of athlon and linux, 
and without redhat, but I can't tell for sure.   Any idea where your 
system might be setting this flag ?

looks like the files are owned by the wrong user (ie the original spec 
builder).
