WARNING: THIS IS A VERY BAD THING TO DO, AND WILL PUT YOUR MACHINE INTO =
AN UNSUPPORTABLE CONFIGURATION!

There is no official way to roll back to the GM version, however the =
installer for 10.6 Update 1 is at , =
and the 10.5 Update 6 is at .

If you manually modify the bundle version in the =
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Resources/Info.plist, the =
installer should install on top of the developer preview, however it =
will not be aware of some of the new content in the DP. This causes some =
tools like Java VisualVM to fail, because it's bundle will contain a =
hodgepodge of GM and DP bits, and the GM installer doesn't know to =
remove the DP bits (because when it was created, the DP bits we not =
invented yet).

This should be enough to test the 1.6.0_17 JVM, but this is hardly a =
"valid" configuration. Installing the 10M3044/9M3144 DP again on top of =
this mixed mess _should_ clean up the GM bits and put you into a valid =
DP configuration. Probably. Most likely.

If things get too out of control, you should always be able to move =
aside the /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions =
directory, and re-run either the GM or DP installer, and you should get =
a fully coherent Java installation (modulo the tools in /usr/share/java =
and a other few exceptions in /System/Library which don't really change =
between versions).
