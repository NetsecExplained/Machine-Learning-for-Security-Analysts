Correct, the folder structure clearly shows the plugins folder, it is my
understanding that both packages come from the sources I mentioned in my
previous e-mail.
In that plugins folder, for the notification icon, GtkStatusIcon is
used, the diff doesn't mention either EggTrayIcon or GtkStatusIcon, so I
would assume that patch is included.

Still leaves me with this issue, unfortunatly.
