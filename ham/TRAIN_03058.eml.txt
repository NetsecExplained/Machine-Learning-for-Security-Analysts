I think that this is a bug, but I don't know where.  I'm
guessing that it has something to do with KMS in newer kernels.
But that's just a guess.  I do a lot of work in the text
consoles.  I often use an 80x50 video mode
(via the VGA option of lilo), which generally
works everywhere.  Anyway, I was not happy with the fonts provided
by console-setup; and I wanted to go back to the legacy fonts that are
used by Lenny.  I opened
a thread on this forum about the problem
(http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2009/12/msg01438.html) and
got a satisfactory resolution.  Here's what I would recommend
that you try.  First, make sure that the console-data package
is installed.  Then, in /etc/default/console-setup, set

   FONTFACE=""
   FONTSIZE=""

Then add

   FONT=lat1u-16.psf.gz

In my case, I use lat1u-08.psf.gz as the font, since the 80x50 video
mode requires an eight-pixel-high font; but in your case, since you
apparently use the traditional VGA boot-up hardware text mode
(no framebuffer, I presume), you will need the sixteen-pixel-high
font.

Give that a whirl and see how it goes.  This method gives a larger
selection of fonts to choose from.  (lat1u-16 is a suggestion,
but there are other sixteen-pixel-high fonts you can choose from.
See the /usr/share/consolefonts directory for a complete list.)
And in my opinion, these fonts look better too.  But most importantly,
this method may circumvent the bug you are experiencing.  If it
does circumvent the bug, console-setup is the most suspect package.
