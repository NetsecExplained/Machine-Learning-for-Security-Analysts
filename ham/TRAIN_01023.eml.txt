I'm not familiar with your laptop, but most laptops have a way to switch
back and forth between the internal display and an external display via
the internal keyboard.  On the IBM ThinkPad machines that I use (a 600
and a 390E) it is Fn+F7.  Consult your hardware documentation.

Switching between the two is much easier if your external monitor
is an LCD monitor.  The internal display probably runs at 60 Hz vertical
refresh.  The external monitor, if it is an LCD display, will probably
want to run at 60 Hz vertical refresh also.  An external CRT monitor,
however, will probably have noticeable flicker at 60 Hz vertical refresh.
It will want to use a higher vertical refresh rate: at least 72 Hz.

Switching back and forth dynamically between internal and external monitors
is tricky if they want to use different resolutions and refresh rates.
It often won't work.
