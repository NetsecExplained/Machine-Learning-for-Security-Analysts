If you spawn the new thread in Java, and have it call down into your JNI =

in native code because of the amibuguity here.

Be advised, however, that the thread where the static initializer is =
running is holding the monitor lock for the class being loaded. The =
monitor is not released until the static initializer returns and class =
initialization is complete. This can result in deadlock when a helper =
thread attempts to do anything with the class while the static =
initializer is still running. I think it is in the JVM specification =
where this is spelled out. I had to do some digging through it once, a =
long time ago, to resolve a deadlocking issue (involving the native =
Carbon native event thread, which tells you how long ago this was).=
