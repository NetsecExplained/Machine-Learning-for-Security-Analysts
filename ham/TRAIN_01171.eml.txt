Dear Readers,
With all the corporate scandals--such as WorldCom and Enron--surrounding us, who can you trust nowadays? Well, for starters, you can trust the CNET Message Boards. The CNET Message Boards are as real as it gets. When it comes down to giving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the Boards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life experiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common interest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky execs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or question 
in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed.

Why I don't use firewalls
Do you need some honest opinions? Despite all the horror stories that you hear of hackers and Trojans intruding on one's personal computer, hear why one of our veteran moderators refuses to use a firewall. This discussion gets a bit heated, but her point was well taken. Take a look and see why she refuses, and if you have a cent or two to throw in, the donation jar is wide open.

The scoop on USB 2.0
The chances are that the next time you pick up an external computer peripheral, it will be utilizing USB 2.0 to connect to your computer. So what is USB 2.0? Is it that much faster than USB 1.1? Will your current USB port be compatible with peripherals with the new version? Well if you have similar questions, I gathered up some discussion on this topic in hopes that it will bring a better understanding of what's in store for USB 2.0. Take your pick.

If you're in that same boat and looking for the best ways to back up some of that important data of yours, this discussion is for you. Have a look. More Computer Newbies discussions

Warning for kids and teens online
If you're a parent, this may be something that you may want to read about kids online. I found it interesting enough to pass along because I know someday I'll be faced with the same worries when my kids are out surfing the web. So have a look, and if it doesn't interest you, pass it on to someone who may find it informative.
