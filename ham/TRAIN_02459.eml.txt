Very interesting --- but

My quick googling reveals many USB drive enclosures for both ATA and SATA
but the marketers don't make mention of S.M.A.R.T . What is the brand of
your enclosure. I want to look for it, in particular, and see if it claims
the feature that you have discovered. Actually, on looking a little more
closely, I'm not seeing any case of a single enclosure that can be used
with both ATA and SATA. Do I read your post correctly - your enclosure can
contain either a SATA or an ATA, and work over USB? But SMART only works
when it is enclosing an ATA?
