Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem.  If untrusted strangers
are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that
you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create
an rcpthosts file or something).

Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I
would suggest tossing qmail-scanner 
and SpamAssassin  into the mix as well.
The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter
does its work (including razor-check invocations).

Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying
relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find
out how to do that, go to  (which, incidentally,
should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for "qmail
newbie's guide to relaying".
