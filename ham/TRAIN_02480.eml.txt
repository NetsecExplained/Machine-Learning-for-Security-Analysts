Hi,
I have Sun VirtualBox. It's easy to use and install.
The guests OS that I tried and work: Debian, MEPIS, OpenSolaris, 
OpenSuse, Solaris 10, XP and some other Linux distros. DesktopBSD and 
FreeBSD work but can't get GUI -that can be lack of my knowledge.

Same with open VirtualBox except I think that there is no USB support.

Aqemu (qemu) easy to use and install -DesktopBSD work's with GUI.

I think that all VM have file sharing, printing depends on USB if you 
have USB printer.
