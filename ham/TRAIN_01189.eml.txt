recompiling the kernel with a different version nameHi

I've just recompiled the kernel from sources with the command

fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-recompiled kernel-image 
kernel-headers

and installed it successfully.

However, the kernel name is

2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompiled

and that "+drm33.1" seems to cause problems to Eclipse which does not 
recognize it as a valid version (I think the problem is with the '+' 
character).

Is there a way to change the version so that I can do without that '+'?

thanks in advance
	Lorenzo
