Good old /etc/X11/xorg.conf. There isn't one on this system. I used to 
hate fiddling around with that file. The transition to other means of 
controlling video has been fraught with peril for some, but a few false 
starts with video configuration on this system under various 
distributions finally convinced me that the voyage needed to be undertaken.

Many thanks for your response.

PS: I also sent this message from a different e-mail account. I figured 
I'd resend it to clear up any question about who was actually responding 
to the thread. Sorry about the dumbness. Too much swapping of systems 
and info around this place.
