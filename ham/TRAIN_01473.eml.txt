Which version of KDE, 3.x or 4.x? (I don't remember a task bar applet
for mounting removable media from my KDE 3.x days - I always triggered
mounting via the icons that appeared on the desktop for removable media
- but I might simply not know about alternatives.)

Mounting worked for you earlier, so I assume that your users are all
members of the "plugdev" group already. I would like to see the output
of:

  awk '//,/<\/policy>/' /etc/dbus-1/system.d/hal.conf

It would be interesting to know if regular users can mount USB sticks
using pmount or pmount-hal on the command line.

AFAIK, you should not have any entries in fstab for removable devices
that you want to be handled by KDE/Gnome/whatever_other_DE via the
dbus/hal mechanism. In any case, I would avoid trying to mix different
approaches.

I have seen that complaint before, also for systems on which mounting
worked perfectly for single-user sessions, and I am not sure if a
satisfactory solution exists. (I have no need for running multiple KDE
sessions on the same machine, therefore I do not know much about this
issue.)

Well, it is a problem for you right now, so why not try to solve it?
Besides, udisks has the same main developer as hal, so I doubt that it
will be so radically different that hal know-how will become useless. I
have played around a bit with udisks yesterday, it seems to follow the
same basic concepts as hal. AFAICT, udisks-daemon is simply an upgraded
version of hald that is specialized on block devices, as one part of a
more modular approach to hardware abstraction.
