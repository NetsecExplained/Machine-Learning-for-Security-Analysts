I too have an  Abit NF7 (tho' not an -S).  The memory was installed by the=
=20
shop where I bought the components of my computer.  (I was intending to bui=
ld=20
it myself and he didn't trust me with the CPU or memory!!)  He told me taht=
 I=20
had dual channel memory installed, and would need to replace both 256 Mb=20
sticks if I increased the memory capacity.

I have never seen any sign of dual channel operation. (Tho' I didn't know w=
hat=20
to look for, which hardly helped!)

dmidecode gives:

Memory Device
       [snip]
        Size: 256 MB
        Form Factor: DIMM
        Set: None
        Locator: A0
        Bank Locator: Bank0/1
        [snip]

Memory Device
        [snip]
        Size: No Module Installed
        Form Factor: DIMM
        Set: None
        Locator: A1
        Bank Locator: Bank2/3
        [snip]

Memory Device
        [snip]
        Size: 256 MB
        Form Factor: DIMM
        Set: None
        Locator: A2
        Bank Locator: Bank4/5
       =20
Would I be correct in taking this to mean  that the memory modules appear t=
o=20
be incorrectly installed, and that I could improve my memory performance by=
=20
moving one of the modules that dual channel functions?  And also, if that=20
does not give me enough improvement (which it almost certainly won't), I=20
could add another module in the third channel, which would not necessarily=
=20
need to be the same size as the other two?
