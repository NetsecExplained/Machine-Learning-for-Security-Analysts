What should really be the "big warning" is mixing releases... I don't see
this as possible however. How is dpkg to know that the libc6 upgrade is not
for security patches or point release?  I suppose something could be put in
place so that the security repo is treated differently.

The best way to avoid this: Don't mix releases. When necessary, its
generally safer to build the source packages. You will also realize how far
you are digging into testing when you start needing to backport libs.

This is potentially reversible, but you should know in the future that core
packages such as libc6, perl, python, and etc should never be mixed between
releases.

I have no advice for fixing the current issue... Only avoiding it in the
future.
