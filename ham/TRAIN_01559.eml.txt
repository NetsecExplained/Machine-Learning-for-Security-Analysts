=46irst you need a (basic) regular expression (BRE) that matches "\paragrap=
h{}". =20
The '\' is a BRE special character, so it needs to be escaped.  Also, the "=
{}"=20
is a bit troublesome with find/-exec, so we will match it using the constru=
ct=20
"[{][}]".

The definitive documentation for regular expression is the Single UNIX=20
Specification, Version 3 -- Base Definitions, Chapter 9.  I don't actually=
=20
like (man 7 regex) for this.

This gives us the regex "\\paragraph[{][}]".  Now, we need to get that regu=
lar=20
expression to sed.  (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e "s/\\paragraph[{][}]=
//"=20
{} \;) won't work, since during Quote Removal, one of the '\'s are dropped =
and=20
neither find nor sed "sees" it.

The shell does a *lot* of processing to the text you type before it reaches=
=20
the command you are invoking.  Single UNIX Specification, Version 3 -- Shel=
l=20
and Utilities, Chapter 2 is the core documentation, but some shells are muc=
h=20
more featureful.

We can either use (find $dir -type f -exec sed -i -e 's/\\paragraph[{][}]//=
'=20
{} \;) OR--my preference--(regex=3D'\\paragraph[{][}]'; find $dir -type f -=
exec=20
sed -i -e "s/$regex//" {} \;) to make sure sed gets that important '\'.

Also, I left it out, but you may want the "g" flag to the "s"ubstitute comm=
and=20
in sed.  Otherwise, only one occurrence of the regex will get eliminated pe=
r=20
line.
