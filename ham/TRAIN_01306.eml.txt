Ok. It looks like you haven't run the latest make-kpkg.

I just did a rebuild of an existing built source tree. The make-kpkg
output contained 8839 lines of output just to describe unlinking things
in the debian/... directory. That 8839 lines is about 980kB. There was
later objcopy output from the make-kpkg process amounting to 180kB. The
rest of the output is 73kB. It's a significant difference.
