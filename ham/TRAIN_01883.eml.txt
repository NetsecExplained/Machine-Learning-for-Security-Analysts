Re: CD player UI for toddlers
Our preschoolers (2 and 4) use Winamp with a Pokemon skin.  It's the
2-yr-old who figured out he could put it into a sidebar menu so all
he need do is click there to launch their favourite MP3 playlist.

What /we/ need is a good "barely literate" email program.  Years ago
the university of Hawaii had a word processor that included a
voice-assist and also would pop up menus for common completions as
words were typed; even further back there was a DOS shareware editor
that did that latter function extremely well (targetted at the
handicapped).  With just those little bits of assists, maybe some
clever use of pictograms too, I bet kindergarten kids could handle
email.
