Well, for watching movies in your PC you can always use the media player 
abilities to re-scale the video into 4:3 aspect ratio :-)

But if your vga card cannot provide higher resolutions to the monitor, 
then you are stuck: LCDs can only work well at their native resolution. 
So your first step should be to find the specs of your VGA card and check 
what is the maximum resolution it can provide.

Your display will be happy at 1680x1050@60Hz.
