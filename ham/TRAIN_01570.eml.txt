Disney has named a new president of Walt Disney Parks, replacing Paul Pressler, 
the exec who did his damnedest to ruin Disneyland, slashing spending (at the 
expense of safety and employee satisfaction), building the craptastical 
California Adventure, reducing the number of SKUs available for sale in the 
Park stores, and so on. The new president, James Rasulo, used to be head of 
Euro Disney. Link[1] Discuss[2]
