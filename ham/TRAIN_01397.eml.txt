Re: AUGD: Displaying iPad at a meeting, what doesn't workYep.  When I did the iPhone demo a couple years back we duck-taped my video camera to the arm of a boom mike, pointed it down at a flat surface, hooked the video camera up to the projector, and did it that way.  Took a bit of finagling the light and angles so everything was visible.

We called it "the miracle of MMOOS-vision"

As we are MMOOS, the Maine Macintosh Owners & Operators Society (mmoos.net).

OK, it was funny at the time.  Guess you had to be there.
