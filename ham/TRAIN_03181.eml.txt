What do you want to achieve in this thread on this debian-kde user support=
=20
mailinglist?

Resurrecting KDE 3.5 for Debian?

Well did you?

If not, I suggest you to try it elsewhere.

Possible places are:

=2D debian-qt-kde@lists.debian.org since that is where development of Debia=
n=20
KDE packages is coordinated

=2D Trinity Desktop Environment / Vector Linux

This is for KDE user support. KDE 3.5 in Lenny. KDE 4 in Squeeze unless=20
someone - except the current Debian KDE / Qt developer team - does and=20
maintains KDE 3.5 packages that are co-installable and meet Debians high=20
packaging standards.

This list is not for development issues like developing / maintaining KDE=20
3.5 packages for Squeeze.

So IMHO any further request for KDE 3.5 in Squeeze is off topic on this=20
list as Debian KDE/Qt maintainers repeatedly said they won't.

You want KDE 3.5 for Squeeze? Spend your energy towards that goal. Here it=
=20
apparently does not change the situation.

Ciao,
