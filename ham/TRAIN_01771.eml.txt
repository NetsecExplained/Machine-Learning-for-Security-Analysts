That's an interesting sticking point. In reality, the probability of my 
accidental participation in distribution of the software is probably 
pretty low, but I can certainly see the principle involved.

That is most certainly my aim.

And, if I were stuck in a situation where I really, really needed to use 
(for instance) proprietary drivers so that I could use the 3D 
acceleration capabilities of the nvidia cards, or if I needed to use the 
wireless cards that require proprietary firmware, I'd do so -- though it 
would irk me a little bit, perhaps enough to goad me on into getting new 
hardware.

It's not a religion, but the ideas are important to me. And, as I said, 
I'm also just genuinely interested in seeing how well I can do without 
the proprietary bits. The resolve is made all the stronger by my 
experiences in industry where I see what I think are some pretty unwise 
decisions being made by companies who are often unwittingly tying their 
fortunes irrevocably to the whims (business models, I think they call 
them) of other companies -- companies whose interests might (and do) run 
in a counter direction.

The industries I've worked in might not have had very many choices (at 
least without incurring huge development costs) when making their 
hardware / software decisions. But, as an individual, I can do what I 
danged well please -- even if others may think that it looks like I'm 
just cutting off my nose to spite my face.
