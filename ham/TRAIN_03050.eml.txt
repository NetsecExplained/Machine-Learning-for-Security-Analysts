Re: Re[3]: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...)Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men.

As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.
