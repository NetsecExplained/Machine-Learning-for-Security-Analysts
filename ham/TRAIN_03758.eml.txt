Ah, this is so deeply frustrating! KDE 4.4 sounds great but it is
nowhere to be found in Debian but in experimental and it sounds like it
is nowhere near ready for production.  3.5.10 is truly and completely,
unusably broken for calendaring other than in a standalone world.

It looks like Evolution has introduced webdav support for contacts in
2.24 and we can grab 2.28 from testing.  That sounds better than
experimental so maybe we need to abandon KMail (sigh) and think about
Evolution instead.  Thanks, all - John
