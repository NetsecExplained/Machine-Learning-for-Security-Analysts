I've done that too, on many production servers. The only little
(unimportant) catch is to replace "kernel-headers" by "glibc-kernheaders",
a simple "apt-get install glibc-kernheaders" taking care of that.

Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and
releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,
some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through
apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered
as the newest, thus being kept on the system.

As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc
(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll
probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)
