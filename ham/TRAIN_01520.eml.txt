Techs lose again with Seibel earnings miss, AOL questions
Siebel Systems fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations and offered a worse-than-expected outlook, helping to depress technology shares Thursday.

Despite a forecast from IBM in line with analyst expectations, investors seemed more focused on reports of a possible management shake-up at AOL Time Warner and on a Washington Post story questioning accounting methods at America Online. CNET's Tech index shed 24.59 points, or 2.45 percent, to close at 982.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 40.30 points, or 2.88 percent, to close at 1,356.95.

Amid news The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators held steady in June, broader markts also headed south. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 133.0 points, or 1.56 percent, to close at 8,409.4. The S&P; 500 slid 24.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 881.56--another multi-year low.














AOL used unconventional business practices-Post 
America Online Inc. boosted its revenue figures through unconventional deals from 2000 to 2002, before and after its acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

IBM posts sharp drop in quarterly profits 
International Business Machines Corp. on Wednesday said it eked out a second-quarter profit of just a few pennies a share as the world's largest computer maker took a $1.4 billion charge to exit money-losing businesses and cut jobs.

But even without the big charge, earnings at IBM, which sells everything from computer software to microchips to computer services, fell sharply as corporations concerned about their own bottom lines cut back on technology spending.INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 72.05 1.92% 

Nokia sees slight rise in Q3 handset sales vs Q2 
Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia said on Thursday it expected a slight rise in handset unit sales for both itself and the industry in the third quarter versus the April-June period.

J.P. Morgan stays cautious toward Qwest in tech notes 7/18/02 
Analyst Marc Crossman repeats a "market performer" rating on the telecom firm and further lowers his estimates on what he sees as continued deterioration of Qwest's local and long-distance businesses. Crossman says Qwest could violate a bank agreement by the end of this quarter if it doesn't close a significant asset sale. And he argues the firm faces a funding shortage next year that can't be satisfied by selling its eastern directories businesses alone.QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTL INC 2.74 14.64%
