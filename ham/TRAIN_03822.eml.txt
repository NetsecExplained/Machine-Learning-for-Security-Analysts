Steve:

There are many more possible reasons than three. Given Camaleon's report of
his investigation, I think it is like that the real reason is something else,
not on your list. Perhaps, for instance, he is insane and is confined to a
mental institution where some of the more lucid inmates are allowed access
to the computers and internet. Whatever the real reason, Camaleon seems to
have exhausted the publicly available options for communication. I thank him.
