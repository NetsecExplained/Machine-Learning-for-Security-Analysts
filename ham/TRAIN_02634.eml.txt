sharing NFS folder in multiples serversHi again:

I have a big NFS partition shared and mounted on 3 debian serves
(mountpoint /snapshosts). NFS partition es ext3 and I have a backup
script, on every server, which makes a tar from some   lvm snaphost .
I mean, my 3 servers maek their tar backup at the same time on
/snapshots NFS partition. This partition is only use to make this
backups. My question is:

Is recommendable to use  gfs or other filesystem insted of ext3 in
/snapshots NFS partition?
Any other recommendation?

thanks in advance.
