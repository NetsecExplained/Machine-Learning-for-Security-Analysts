How do I fsck and XFS file system in "Squeeze"
        OK, I'm stumped.  I was having some problems which were likely related
to the old kernel in Debian "Lenny", so I upgraded to "Squeeze" in
order to alleviate the issue, which it apparently has.  Now, however, I
need to fsck the main array on the box, which is formatted as XFS.  The
xfs-repair utility is not on the upgraded system.  (I was forced to do
a fresh install of the boot drive.)  How can I obtain the XFS file
utilities - particularly xfs-repair - under "Squeeze"?
