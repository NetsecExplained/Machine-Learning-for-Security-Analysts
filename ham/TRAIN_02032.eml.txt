If 
                      your PDA screen taps sometimes don't seem to register correctly, 
                      use the built-in digitizer to easily re-adjust the settings.
Go 
                    to the main Applications screen and tap on Preferences. Choose 
                    'Digitizer' from the upper-right pull-down menu. Follow the 
                    simple on-screen instructions to realign your stylus with 
                    the screen.
