CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW
The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email
Saturday, July 20, 2002

Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Compute=
r trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it migh=
t be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.


Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new=
 iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.

The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u=
se Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi=
sting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with=
 a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo=
r $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m=
odels for Windows users with MusicMatch software.

As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon=
itor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut=
ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.

Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will =
be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with =
improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t=
he background photo as often as every 5 seconds.

But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a ch=
eap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a disc=
ounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr=
ent users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will h=
ave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst=
em for the retail price of $129.

Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu=
alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s=
hare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser=
vices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou=
s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.

Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web serv=
ices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t=
o charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service=
s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a=
 service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu=
res.

Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell w=
ith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture=
. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously =
free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when=
 free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to=
 form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently=
.

To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of=
 services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz=
ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,=
 an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel=
l for the program.

Microsoft's moves
Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a=
 rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software=
 bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re=
bate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for=
 those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.

The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no=
t met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000=
 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the =
program went on sale last November.

Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third co=
llection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after=
 a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c=
ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o=
perating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co=
uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f=
ixes are available as separate downloads.


Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro=
soft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a =
site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T=
he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java =
inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the=
 forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.

Somebody's watching you

You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yah=
oo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter=
 to swap out a handful of words such as "mocha" and "eval" that=
 pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.

The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as "Web enhanced" can contai=
n JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaS=
cript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser=
 to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for =
example.

"Mocha" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced =
e-mail. Typing "mocha:" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will =
open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma=
nds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command =
line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'=
s knowledge.


On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. g=
overnment is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious acti=
vity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled mor=
e details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan=
 to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or =
suspicious behavior.

"The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the dail=
y course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual=
 or suspicious activity in public places," according to the TIPS Web site. =
But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan,=
 fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib=
ly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.
