QuickTime Player 7 recording problem (maximum duration for the file
	has been reached)After one of the recent QuickTime updates QT Player 7 (Pro) seems to  
have lost its ability to record movies from video digitizer  
components. It shows preview all right but once the user presses the  
Record button, it writes exactly one frame to the .mov file and stops  
with the error message "Recording stopped because the maximum duration  
for the file has been reached". The same thing happened with all vdigs  
I have installed on my Mac, including Apple's SoftVDigX sample.

QT Player does record movies from iSight but unfortunately it's not  
doing that via QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer (otherwise it would be  
possible to trace QT component calls and find the difference between  
Apple's vdig and mine). And every piece of software that works with  
QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer, works with my vdig too. Ugh...

The following versions do NOT work for me:

QuickTime Player 7 Version 7.6.6 (1709) + QuickTime Version 7.6.6  
(1729) + Mac OS X 10.6.3
QuickTime Player Version 7.6.6 (1632) + QuickTime Version 7.6.6 (1674)  
+ Mac OS X 10.5.8

This one (still) does work:

QuickTime Player Version 7.6.4 (518.35) + QuickTime Version 7.6.4  
(1327.73) + Mac OS X 10.4.11

Does anyone know a way to make a vdig component (say, SoftVDigX)  
compatible with the latest QT Player 7?

Thanks in advance,
-Slava
