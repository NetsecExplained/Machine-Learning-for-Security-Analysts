Not always.  Apt depends on the dependency graph being consistent, other 
than perhaps containing a cycle or two.  If the Debian maintainers slip 
up and screw up the dependencies (or the user is switching back and 
forth between distributions, say among stable, testing, and unstable), 
apt can get confused.  It has happened to me several times.  In such 
cases, using aptitude sometimes helps.  I have also resorted to 
installing by hand, though this may not have been strictly necessary.
