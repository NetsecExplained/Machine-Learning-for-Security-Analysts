There are a few different ways to deal with not exposing your password
to the world, but one thing I do want to note: in a hosted situation,
you should have a user home directory in addition to the directory for
your website.  If you need a file to be inaccessible from the web, you
can just put it in your home directory.  There's no need for root
level permissions.
