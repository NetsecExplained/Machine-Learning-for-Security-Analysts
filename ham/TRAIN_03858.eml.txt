I see nothing about the failure. All seems to go fine, Postfix 
establishes a connection with remote server and silently fails :-/

Put Postfix into a more verbose logging. In "main.cf":

***
debug_peer_level = 2
debug_peer_list = NEWSERVER
***

Reload Postfix and try again.

P.S. 1 - Check the more basic here: saslauth mechanisms being used for 
authenticating and of course, a correct password in "/etc/postfix/
sasl_passwd" O:-)

P.S. 2 - Remember that "535 5.7.3 Authentication unsuccessful" is a 
message coming from Exchange server -not Postfix- so it would be great if 
you could review the logs from the MS server side.
