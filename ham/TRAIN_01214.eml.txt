Compositing two moviesI need to play two movies in sync, compositing them in a custom way. 
One approach I came up with is to put the movies in QTMovieLayers (Core 
Animation), and then I can use a Core Image filter for the compositing. 
  Does that sound reasonable, or is there another approach that is 
likely to perform significantly better?
