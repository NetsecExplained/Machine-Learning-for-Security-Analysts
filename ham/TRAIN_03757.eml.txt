OP wrote: "ext3 can have only 32000 files/folders under a folder and I
hit that limit."

As I demonstrated, ext3 can have 50000 files in a "folder" (directory).
Or as many more as the filesystem has space for.

The 31998 subdirectories limit is rarely encountered because using a
multi-level directory heirarchy is so much more efficient.
