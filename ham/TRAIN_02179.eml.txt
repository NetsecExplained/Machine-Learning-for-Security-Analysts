Re: problems with apt/synaptic
Although it looks like I'm replying to myself, I just haven't gotten
Matthias' reply yet, although I can see it on the website (and I did
subscribe, but probably to the digest).

So, it looks like it worked, and the files are updated..  very strange.  

Maybe something went wrong updating apt from my old version (as used
with rh7.2), and this one.  Lemme try totally uninstalling and
reinstalling it..
