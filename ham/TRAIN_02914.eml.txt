I just have tested with Lenny and seems to be working fine (Connect to 
server → ftp w/login). That creates a new network place I can connect to.

After that, I open the FTP session by providing credentials and copy a 
local file to remote FTP location and is stored fine, no error message or 
something that indicates the PUT operation has failed. 

Then, if I connect from another dedicated FTP client, I can see the new 
file there, so all looks good. 

Have you tested with another FTP server?

P.S. AFAIK, I don't have installed "gvfs-fuse".
