It's easy if you are planning ahead.  This guy is stuck with an
application (presumably closed-source) that already requires a flat file
structure.

The on-screen rebus for a directory was a little dohicky that Apple's
designers imagined looked like a picture of a manila folder.  The idea
was to sooth computerphobic office workers by making their screens look
just like their desktops.  That's the origin of the "desktop metaphor".
Fortunately, they did not decide to label disk drives "drawers".

I do, of course.  I even have several working 500Ds somewhere in the
junk box.

Wikipedia says "The word dialling originally referred to the creation of
the mathematics required to create a sundial face to tell time based on
the position of the sun. Those skilled in the art were referred to as
dialists or gnomonists; taken from the word gnomon (a device using a
shadow as an indicator)."
