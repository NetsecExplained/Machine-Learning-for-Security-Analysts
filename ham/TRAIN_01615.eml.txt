Thanks.  I had misinterpreted one of the Debian blog postings about 4.4.
I see now that it is expected the next stable will ship with 4.4.4.  Has
there been any word about when 4.4.x will be moved to testing? I'm
really hesitant to introduce all the libraries that will be dragged in
if I install KDE from unstable into a production environment.  I even
hesitate with testing but we are so desperate to make Kontact work with
Zimbra that we would take a chance - John
