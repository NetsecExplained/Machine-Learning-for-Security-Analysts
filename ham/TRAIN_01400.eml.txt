OO.writer can't its file.Good day.


I can not open a file in 'oowriter' by 'edit' user, the program says, "Write error. The file could not be written." Running from console gives no additional info. The version is 3.2.0-4.

ls -l 1.odt
returns:
-rw-r--r-- 1 edit we 64145 2010-03-29 10:39 1.odt

Therefore I see that the problem does not lay in permissions. Then what? - Buggy oowriter?


Thanks for Your time.
