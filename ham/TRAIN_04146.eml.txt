Indeed so, in this case. In the general case, it might be quicker to 
enable DHCP than to find out what network the router resets to. Usually 
192.168.0. or 192.168.1., but not always.

In the days before Internet dongles, the only Net connection available 
was usually the one on the other side of an apparently non-functional 
router, and the customer had no idea where the book/CD was.

And to be honest, I normally run XP on my laptop, and it's just ticking 
or unticking a box. Windows has moved on, no reboot necessary... I can 
remember needing the installation CD to change IP addresses on 95/98.
