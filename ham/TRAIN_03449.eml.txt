Difficult to judge, since I somehow lost track of what exactly you tried
to achieve and what is the nature of the document.

If you are simply afraid, that someone would use this document as
her/his own work you could watermark the pdf and convert it to a low
resolution bitmap (as others have already suggested). If the document
was later misused, you could just show your nice, high quality printout
without watermarks to prove that you are the real author.

Another way might be to hand out that bad quality printout on some
special paper, either coloured or with rules and keep the pdf version to
yourself. It will be about as difficult to retype/recreate such a
document from paper as from retyping it from screen, which was your
first choice (disallow printing, allow screen viewing).

I think you might have gotten better replies in shorter time, if you had
been more explicit and clear about what you try to achieve.
