Ext3 basically syncs to disk every 5 seconds or so.  Ext4 didn't, but it's=

possible that has been / will be put back.  XFS uses longer gaps between di=
sk=20
syncs by default, but it is tunable.

You could always use the "sync" file system option to avoid the whole issue=
=2E =20
If that's no good enough, a simple shell script (while sleep 5; do sync; do=
ne)=20
running as root (perhaps started from init) will fill basically the same ro=
le.

Both XFS and Ext3/4 recover through journal replay, and it is usually enoug=
h. =20
Rarely, a manual filesystem check will be required, and xfs_check is usuall=
y=20
much faster than fsck.ext3 or even fsck.ext4.
