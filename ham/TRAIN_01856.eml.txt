Search for a thread named "PolicyKit Authorization (System Settings) crashes every time"
First msg can be found here: http://lists.debian.org/debian-kde/2009/12/msg00073.html
and it continues here: http://lists.debian.org/debian-kde/2010/03/msg00087.html

It is indeed an issue with KDE 4.4 and has to do with the switch to policykit-1, which is in review 
and will/should be included (again) with KDE 4.5
