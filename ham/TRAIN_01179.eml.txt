Works just fine here:

$ nl /etc/fstab | sed -n '1,2p;4p'
     1  # /etc/fstab: static file system information.
     2  #
     4  proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0
0
$ nl /etc/fstab | busybox sed -n '1,2p;4p'
     1  # /etc/fstab: static file system information.
     2  #
     4  proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0
0


So please give some more details about your system (version of Debian,
version of sed, etc.). Also please tell us what actually happens when
you try to run it.
