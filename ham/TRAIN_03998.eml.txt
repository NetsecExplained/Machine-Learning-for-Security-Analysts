What seems to work for me (and I agree, it's pretty confusing,
especially when you add 'man grub-set-default' to the mix) is to
include these three lines in menu.lst:

default	saved
# updatedefaultentry=true
# savedefault=true

I'm not quite certain which are necessary, but as I've said, this seems
to give me the behavior that I (and, IIUC, you) want.
