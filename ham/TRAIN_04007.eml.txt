Given that you have (presumably) installed some or all 'openjdk' 
packages, you could get a list of the installed files, per package, and 
see if any of the names listed point to anything of "interest".

Files in /etc, /etc/... (where ... might be 'openjdk'?), files in /lib 
or /usr/lib that are not library files, etc. could either be the source, 
or point to other files to check.

This is a 'brute force' sort of technique, but it has helped me in a 
couple of cases where all else had failed.
