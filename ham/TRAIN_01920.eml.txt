Mmm, yes, sounds weird. 

And you only experience this with some of my replies, right? Are you 
using any kind of spamfilter at your end? :-?

I use Gmane (e-mail to news gateway) to send posts and read the list via 
Pan newsreader.

or in the worst cases, they are lost) but if the post reached the list 
archive, you (everyone subscribed) also should get it:
