Please, let me know what KDE 4 is missing for you. KDE 4.4 has only a
handful of regressions from KDE 3.5.10, and they are not dealbreakers.
Some of those are addressed in KDE 4.5.

The "KDE 4 sux" time has passed. If you still have problems with KDE
4, then please let me know what they are so that they can be fixed.

Thanks!
