i am not familiar with those settings in linux. so i did some searching.
http://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktopHowTo

which says:
"This is a problem with the way D-Bus figures out what groups you are
a member of. All users should be added to plugdev, netdev, and
optionally powerdev, in /etc/groups. Any way of automating this in
Debian?"

i look around in /etc/ and find there are 2 group files.

mobildebian:/etc# nano group
group   group-

im guessing i need to remove group [ which is empty ] and rename
group- to be the group file.

correct?
