Oh, my ... was I happy boy ... until now :)
No, I did not :(
So I downloaded MD5SUMS file from internet, Its content is:
202b8e90d52b7eb3ed7294211f5aadfe  debian-504-i386-DVD-1.iso
ad134f6556f8b79d39508a844ff59925  debian-504-i386-DVD-2.iso
45b9ad2bfaa20547f23471829e2f7d7e  debian-504-i386-DVD-3.iso
b46ee70c83e4e02107e4a5c271927459  debian-504-i386-DVD-4.iso
ca1ec6584d9e5df2df958ce5d647fb91  debian-504-i386-DVD-5.iso
4b07df455905e47f2db772b3715f46ca  debian-update-5.0.4-i386-DVD-1.iso

After that I was inserting my DVDs in oredr 1-5 without mounting it
and issued command 'md5sum /dev/hdc' which produced this output
(one line for each DVD in turn):

md5sum: /dev/hdc: Input/output error
d6dd905d890c6f94e164f2b6c027c8a4  /dev/hdc
1b662e97035cce34e1e9fa42223cdfc5  /dev/hdc
6e0279dcd3dc5ff0dcf6e6188f6df2b3  /dev/hdc
15462fa19c0c49f517c66fb76e6ce109  /dev/hdc

Therefore DVD 1 seems to be seriously damaged (thou I had not any
problems with it when installing any program - yet), and DVD 2-4 have
different checksums, but I am not sure if this is proper way to check
DVDs now when they are already burned on disc.

Then I inserted DVD 3, mounted it and run 'cd /cdrom; md5sum -c md5sum.txt'
It printed one line per package and concluded with:

md5sum: WARNING: 167 of 4996 computed checksums did NOT match

I did the same for DVD 2,4 and 5 but in now md5sum did not find any
package with bad checksum! All lines are like this:

./pool/main/z/zvbi/zvbi_0.2.30-1_i386.deb: OK
./pool/main/z/zzuf/zzuf_0.12-1_i386.deb: OK

while with DVD 3 there were 167 lines like this:

./pool/main/a/asc/asc-data_2.1.0.0-1_all.deb: FAILED
./pool/main/b/balazar/balazar_0.3.4.ds1-3_all.deb: FAILED
./pool/main/h/hgsvn/hgsvn_0.1.6-2_all.deb: FAILED
./pool/main/s/simutrans/simutrans-data_100.0+ds1-4_all.deb: FAILED

I guess I am doing something wrong as one method showed that DVDs 2,4,5
are bad while other test passed OK. At least I do know that
packages I was trying to install from DVD 3 are bad.

Thank you.
Martin
