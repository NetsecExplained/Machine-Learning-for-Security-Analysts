Dual channel memory questionHi,

The Wiki on dual channel memory says:

"The memory modules are installed into matching banks, which are usually 
color coded on the motherboard. These separate channels allow each 
memory module access to the memory controller, increasing throughput 
bandwidth."

Does that mean that placing 2 1GB modules, each into a different colored 
slot, is faster than putting 1 2GB module into one slot and leaving the 
other 3 slots empty?
