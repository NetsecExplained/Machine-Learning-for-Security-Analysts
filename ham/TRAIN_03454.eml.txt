Valuable yes, since it provides useful video processing apps. I'm using
it also since recently. It probably is reliable, although for me it did
  break vlc the moment I started using it.

Good to know.

How come there is no link anywhere on debian.org pointing to
debian-multimedia.org? Anything to establish a chain of trust. As it is,
I looked and looked but didn't find. Even when searching for
"multimedia" on debian.org, it does not mention debian-multimedia.org at
all. Not even when searching for "debian-multimedia". Every new debian
user trying to verify the credibilitiy of debian-multimedia.org would
have given up at this point for sure.

With the information that Marillat is a Debian developer (and the
precise spelling of his name) I was actually able to go to the
developer's page on debian org, find him, and see a link to d-m. So in a
very roundabout way, d-m is actually endorsed by debian.org. But how
would anybody find out about this in a reasonable amount of time?
