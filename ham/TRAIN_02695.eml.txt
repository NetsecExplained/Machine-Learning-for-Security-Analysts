[SAtalk] procmail helpI'm fairly confused here, with Procmail. 
I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in 
private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.  

I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything 
specific on this scenario.

Here's the situation. 
I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into 
it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it 
shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log)  At the end of 
this file, I use 
 :0fw
 | spamc
to call spamassassin.

Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do 
for our corporate masters)  (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed 
that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about 
future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion 
on this point is immaterial)
:0
  * ? test -d $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR || mkdir -p --mode=750 $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR
  { }
:0 c
 $SAVEAT

I have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null  . . .their 
procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this:
:0
  * ^From: .*spermfun.com
  /dev/null

Now I've got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another 
email address (outside the company), so I've got this recipe in her 
/home/$user/.procmailrc file:
:0 c
  !user@domain.tld

It almost looks like procmail's not running a user's copy recipe after a 
global copy recipe, except that I can replace that user's one with 
:0 
 * ^Subject: .*test
  procmail.holder
and get the same result.

The result, to put it succinctly, is "nothing". No forwards go out, no files 
are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the 
user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun 
example above) and still nothing.  However, I can redirect those other 
messages.  In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working- 
other users have no problems.

Any suggestions would be helpful :)
