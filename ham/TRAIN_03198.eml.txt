I do not agree, sorry. PDFLaTeX generally write bigger PDFs, simply
because there is no compression (consider for example
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2004-June/005046.html). Moreover, I
think that psTricks does not work with PDFLaTeX (you need to use PDFTrick=
s).

I also vaguely remember about many situations where, if I had had to use
PDFLaTeX, I would not have been able to produce the same document,
because I would have had to change many packages which were incompatible.=


You might ask on comp.text.tex, this is a better place for this, because
this is my point of view, and it is not shared by the whole community.
