Re: Fw: Re: When are we going to get. [making ALSA rpms]Thanks for this information.  I gave Alsa a try, couldn't figure out how
to enable digital out, although I'm sure if I put enough time into it,
could have gotten it working.  Also when playing mp3s in analog mode,
every time I switched between mp3s there was a bit of static.  Noticed a
new distribution geared towards audio applications, AGNULA
(http://www.agnula.org/) uses Alsa as well.  Seems though the latest
open source emu10k1 drivers (SBLive! 5.1) work fair enough.  Anyone else
experience these problems with Alsa?  Are there alot of people on this
list using Alsa?

Regards,

Lance
