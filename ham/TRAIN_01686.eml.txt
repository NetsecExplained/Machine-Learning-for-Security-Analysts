Security update for Debian Testing - 2010-05-04This automatic mail gives an overview over security issues that were recently 
fixed in Debian Testing. The majority of fixed packages migrate to testing 
from unstable. If this would take too long, fixed packages are uploaded to the 
testing-security repository instead. It can also happen that vulnerable 
packages are removed from Debian testing.

pointing to your normal squeeze mirror. You can use

	aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade
