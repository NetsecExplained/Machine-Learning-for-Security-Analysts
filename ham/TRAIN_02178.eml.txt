That boils down to "it's on by default". Just go turn them off. And
the defaults do not have wobbly windows, wavy effects, or anything
shimmering. Nothing spins either, but the Alt-tab dialogue does slide.
There is plenty of transparency, though, and I hate that too. So I
turn it off.

My mother suffers from what she calls "vertigo" and the effects do not
upset her. Nor do they upset the autistics that I volunteer with. They
are merely an annoyance to those annoyed by them, nothing wild.

Do you mean between tabs? Fixed:

It works that way in KDE 4 as well, so long as you have opened them
from Krunner in the past. That is how I open all my applications.

It's Alt-F5 for the Kmenu. Has been since KDE 3 I think.

It's called System Settings, and with the Tree menu it's very similar.
It is being reworked for KDE 4.5, so if you have any suggestions then
now is the time to make them!

You evaded the question. I cannot help when you evade the question.
