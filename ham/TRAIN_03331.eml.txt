I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that
exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through
misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author
above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.

If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.
