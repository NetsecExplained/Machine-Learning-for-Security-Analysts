No, they just don't exist on mailing lists.  Some KDE 3.5 installations are=

used by people that probably would have problems getting Debian installed a=

would think that "Bugzilla" was a B movie.

It would be nice if KDE got input from all it's users.  Sometimes it gets 1=
00s=20
of users input from a rant from a single email address (their KDE=20
administrator).  Luckily, these events can be written off as=

"just one user's opinion".  :P  The rantor is then summarily dismissed beca=
use=20
they can't put in another 40 hours a week fixing the issues, since they are=

already overworked with the job administering a large KDE 3.5 installation.=

:P

I'm convinced real users exist.  I just don't use my computer like them.

the developers write what they want and then use something else.  You may f=
