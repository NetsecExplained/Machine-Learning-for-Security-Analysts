Hi,

I receive the message `Battery is now fully charged' on my Asus EEE
1000HE under Debian Lenny 5 w. kernel 2.26-2-686, but only once I have
unplugged the cable? For example, the PC might be on AC power for 15
hours, and say nothing. If I then unplug the cable, it tells me that the
battery is _now_ fully charged. Is it normal? Does someone else
experience this?

Thanks,
