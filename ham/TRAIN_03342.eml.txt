=46irst its IMHO.

Second its from what I understood about the different purposes of debian-
kde and qt-kde-ml mailing lists.

And debian-kde is clearly sorted as users mailing list:

Debian in KDE
http://lists.debian.org/users.html

debian-qt-kde: Packages using Qt and/or KDE
http://lists.debian.org/devel.html

So I think my view is not that far off.

So or so: Your posts did not seem to me to bring anyone even the slightest=
=20
bit forward towards having KDE 3.5.

So I finish with a suggestion, how this can work:

=2D--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi developers and users of Debian in KDE,

I set up an Alioth project repository of KDE 3.5 packages that I forward-
ported to Squeeze at:

http://some-alioth-url

Right now I started just with the forward port of the basic KDE packages.

I like to continue that work and to make the package co-installable with=20
KDE 4.=20

I appreciate any helping hand. If you are a user and want to use KDE 3 I=20
encourage you to try may package. Please note they are not co-installable=20
with KDE 4 in the moment. If you are a developer please help me with=20
building and polishing packages.

If you want to help out, subscribe to mailinglist xyz.

Regards,
Mike

Now, how about that, Mike? How about being the change you want to achieve?

Thanks.

Note: KDE 3.5 doesn't really need to be co-installable for those only=20
interested in KDE 3.5. At least not initially.

Just a small start might pull this off for you. But if you do not *act*,=20
probably nothing will happen. You can't change those who are not=20
interested in providing KDE 3.5 for Debian Squeeze. So either you start=20
pulling it off for yourself or it - unless someone else feels the=20
motivation to do it - *will just not happen*.

Its as easy as that.

Ciao,
