I have been a regular on this forum for several months now, and I
know from experience that the topic of the proprietary nvidia driver
has come up as a topic of frustration many times.  I have a couple
of machines at home with nvidia cards in them, and I plan to do
some research in this area and publish my findings on a web page,
assuming that I can find something useful to say.

But first, I've got to get my taxes done!
