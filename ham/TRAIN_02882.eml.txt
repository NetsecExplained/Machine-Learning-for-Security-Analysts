sorry I pasted the wrong name: --revision actually took effect since the 
generated .deb is now (note the 'lore01')

linux-image-2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompiled_lore01_i386.deb

but what I need to do is to get rid of '+drm33.1' which seems to be 
automatically added...

the kernel sources are from the ubuntu lucid package 'linux-source-2.6.32'.

cheers
