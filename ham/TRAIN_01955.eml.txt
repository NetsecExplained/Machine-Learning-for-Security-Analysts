Mouse events on an unfocused window on Mac?I have an application that is designed to do something when the user 
pauses over it with the mouse, especially when the java application is 
unfocused.  From what I can tell, on Mac OS X, unfocused Java windows 
don't get mouse events.  Other applications in Cocoa seem to get this, 
so I'm curious: Is this a bug?  Or was Java for Mac OS X defined this 
way?  Is there a way to get these events?
