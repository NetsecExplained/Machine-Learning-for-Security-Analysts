Well, Unicode, specifically the UTF-8 encoding, is generally the standard for
modern Linux systems. Of course, as long as you are using only characters
that are in ASCII, UTF-8 is compatible... There is also GB 18030, China's
Unicode encoding, but again, it is ASCII compatible.

The Win32, .NET and Java platforms all use UTF-16/USC-2 (it's complicated)
natively, which is not ASCII and is not ASCII compatible.

Joel's Unicode article is from 2003, but still very useful:

Some good essays from Tim Bray:
