The best comparison for India is China. They have similar population,
resources and
historical misfortunes. They even had similar per captia income years back. 
As of today, you definitely see more products made in China than in India.
So if 
you think material well being is what defines a better nation, then you
should look 
at what China is doing differently from India.
