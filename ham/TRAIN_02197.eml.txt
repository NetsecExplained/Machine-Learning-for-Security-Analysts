[Spambayes] test sets?> Check it into the spambayes project.  SF's disks are cheap .

Perhaps more useful would be if Tim could check in the pickle(s?)
generated by one of his training runs, so that others can see how
Tim's training data performs against their own corpora.  This could
also be the starting point for a self-contained distribution (you've
got to start with *something*, and training with python-list data
seems just as good as anything else).
