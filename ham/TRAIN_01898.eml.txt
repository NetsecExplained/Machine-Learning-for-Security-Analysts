I'll post my own repository story here anyway, hope no-one minds.
It may freely be commented on or used in another text.

I have a directory like this:
$ tree  -d
.
|-- current7
|   |-- SRPMS.current
|   |-- SRPMS.gcc3
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- RPMS.current
|       |-- RPMS.gcc3
|       `-- base
|-- redhat-7_2
|   |-- SRPMS.os
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- RPMS.os -> 
|       `-- base
`-- testing
    |-- SRPMS.testing
    `-- redhat
        |-- RPMS.testing
        `-- base

27 directories

I throw updates to current7's rpms and my own stuff (with makefile :) to
testing.
After each new package, 
nice genbasedir -s --progress --topdir=$TOPDIR/ \
testing/redhat testing

(for -s to work, you need to make release files, pinch someones for
exmple)

This stuff is found under apache. I put that url, my keys and all that
into apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away.

As for .fi mirrors, funet is very slow. I think I use tuxfamily for
updates but when I see errata I usually also put that to my own one so
rest of the machines have a shorter path to it.
Funet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects (it used to be (is?)
the main mirror for Linux. It was one of the big pub ftp sites). If
there was a definite apt repository, maybe they might mirror that as
well. I doubt RH would be very keen on using apt and forking a
distribution doesn't seem like an easy option, someone should just start
a project.

opposed to Phillips screws. We're not sure why this matters even a little
bit, but Barry sure seemed to think it was interesting.
