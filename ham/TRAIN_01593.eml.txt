Assuming you can rely on the positions of the blank lines, this seems to 
work. Should be easy to change if you want to rely on SOMETHING being at 
the beginning.

perl -e '$f=1; while(<>) { chomp; if ($_ eq "") { $f=1 } else { if ($f) 
{ $x{$_}=[]; $k=$_; $f=0 } else { push @{$x{$k}}, $_ } } } for(sort keys 
%x) { print $_, "\n", join("\n", @{$x{$_}}), "\n\n" }'

There's probably a perl hacker or two who can do it neater, but as I 
say, it seems to work ;)
