Techs slump with Intel
With investors selling Intel shares before its post-market close earnings announcement, technology stocks dropped Tuesday.

Despite generally upbeat remarks on the economy by Fed Chair Alan Greenspan and news of a profitable quarter from Nextel Communications, CNET's Tech index slipped 12.4 points, or 1.25 percent, to 992.91. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 7.36 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,375.26.

Worse-than-expected earnings from construction machinery maker Caterpillar helped depress broader markets. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166.0 points, or 1.92 percent, to 8,473.1--for its seventh consecutive losing session. The S&P; 500 shed 16.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 900.94--another multi-year low.

Banc of America Securities begins coverage of Power Integrations with a "market performer" rating in tech notes 7/16/02 
Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely to rise much in the short term.POWER INTEGRATIONS 18.72 5.23%
