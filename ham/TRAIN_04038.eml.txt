Note that mysql recently split their server package into a "server" and a=20
"core" package, so you get a minimal mysql installation without a system-

Yes, akonadi will still use mysql internally, but it's (mostly) transparent=

solved.

(Yes, it is not very cool to have mysql running for akonadi and virtuoso fo=
