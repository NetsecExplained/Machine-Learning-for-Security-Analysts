zero brightness post Snow Leopard upgradeOn my white MacBook (2007 eta) that I recently upgraded from Leopard  
to Snow Leopard. I have installed all current updates.

Now, and not before, I notice that frequently when I start to re-use  
the machine that it has zero brightness when it powers up. The  
'increase brightness' control has no effect (but other keys do work).  
If I close the lid but then reopen it before the machine goes to sleep  
that usually does the trick and I have medium(ish) brightness and can  
turn brightness up or down.

I am testing if this is related to X11/Xquartz so thought I would ask  
here if anybody else has experience this problem.

I can provide more h/w details later.

Thanks, M
