Yup. I've blocked telnet and some irrelevant ICMP for a long time. It =

just drop all TCP and UDP traffic to the router's outside IP.

No routing protocols on the outside interface. The VPNs are handled by a =
host in the DMZ. To this router, the VPN traffic looks like just more =
UDP between public IPs.

There's no port forwarding, and NAT all happens inside, on the firewall =
that connects the outside, the DMZ, and the LAN. This router sees only =
my routable address space (and its IP on the 1918 net between it and the =
firewall).
