Thanks again for your reply Camaleón.

I booted up and got the login GUI screen.  Then used the choice of
console login, and using my usual user name, logged in with the CLI.
Then run "startx" ... and lo and behold get my KDE4 main screen!

So I conclude that the problem lies with the GUI KDE login.

Although some might be interested in figuring out exactly the problem, I
take on the role of a "user" here and wish to figure out how to make my
system well again.  (Of course, anyone reading this who wants to delve
into why this is happening, I'd assist.)

If you, or anyone else, could tell me what I can try to do to fix
things, I'd appreciate it.  I know I can do a clean install of
everything, but I would be hopeful that less drastic things might work.
  Any chance of fixing things by doing a reinstall or particular
packages?  If so, not only telling me which packages to try, but also a
little guidance with exactly *how* to do it would be appreciated.

At least at this point, I can get back to most of my old system programs
and data, so the urgency is abated.

I want to throw one other thing in here, just in case it rings a bell or
someone sees some relationship to this password/login problem.  I
mentioned in my original post that I had other problems.  Back in March,
just before my emergency 1-week residence in a hospital, I suddenly
starting having problems with certain programs I regularly use (date was
probably around March 14).  The programs I believe all use GTK.  Some
are: iceape, synaptic, geany.  And here are the results when I try
running them from the command line:

don@kali:~$ sudo synaptic
synaptic: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined
symbol: g_malloc_n
don@kali:~$ iceape
/usr/lib/iceape/iceape-bin: symbol lookup error:
/usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_malloc_n
don@kali:~$ geany
geany: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined
symbol: g_malloc_n
don@kali:~$

Unless there is some relation to my password/login problem of this
thread, I'll start a new thread with the above problem.

Thanks, and if anyone has more ideas on fixing my password/login
problem, please help!

Regards,
Don
