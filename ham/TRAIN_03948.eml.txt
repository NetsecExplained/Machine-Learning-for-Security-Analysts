It looks not so normal to me.

But looking at Debian wiki for EEE systems it seems to be a known issue 
with power management:

Power management

On some models, the battery info is not very precise (jumps from 10% to 
100%, no rate information, etc.). Apparently, this is normal. It appears 
that the userspace battery utilities expect the battery to report mAh, 
but in fact it reports percentage. This is either a bug in the battery 
firmware or a bug in the BIOS; it is known to be fixed with newer BIOS 
versions and kernels ≥ 2.6.25.
