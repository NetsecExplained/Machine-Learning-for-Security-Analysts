Re: Problem with an rpm...Do I need to do anything to recreate anything after deleting this?

I did notice an rpm I made the other day didn't work, and just sat there 
for ages  seemingly doing nothing, which probably did this :(

Ok, now I get:


Fetched 88.1kB in 2m31s (581B/s)
error: cannot get exclusive lock on /var/lib/rpm/Packages
error: cannot open Packages index using db3 - Operation not permitted (1)
E: could not open RPM database:cannot open Packages index using db3 - 
Operation not permitted (1)

Arrrrg.
