There's lots of similar places.  Saskatchewan, for example, once
shared with Iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per
capita, and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with
Iceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the
hundred-thousand-hectares).

It's still curious Iceland leads.  Maybe there's just a deep cultural
curiousity and fascination with watching advertising from the rest of
the world. Maybe they're downloading Bjork videos.
