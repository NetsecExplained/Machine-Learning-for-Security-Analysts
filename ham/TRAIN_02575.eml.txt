093a:2622 webcamI bought a webcam:

Bus 006 Device 004: ID 093a:2622 Pixart Imaging, Inc. 

What should I do, to bring it to life?

I installed cheese, but it doesn't gives any video.

/dev/video doesn't exists.

Is there a script that installs all the webcam drivers?

Or how to find out, what drivers does it need?

Thank you.
