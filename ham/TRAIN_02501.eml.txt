Re: Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 2 and 10.5 Update 7 are liveThis update appears to have broken the SunPKCS11 provider... sort of.

Attempting to use an alternate PKCS11 provider while the one while

security.provider.1=3Dsun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 =
${java.home}/lib/security/sunpkcs11-macosx.cfg

is present in java.security results in things like this (an example from =
jarsigner):

jarsigner error: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Private keys must be =
instance of RSAPrivate(Crt)Key or have PKCS#8 encoding

Replacing security.provider.1 with an instance of BouncyCastle (or =
removing it and renumbering all of the other entries) is a work-around.
