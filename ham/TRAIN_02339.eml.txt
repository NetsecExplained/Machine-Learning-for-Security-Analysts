You should run "aptitude unmarkauto grub-legacy" and remove the
transitional grub package.  Unfortunately the case where a transitional
package A pulls in another package B is not handled well by the package
managers, I always end up "aptitude unmarkauto B; aptitude markauto A"
to tell apt that I want to keep the new package and that it can remove
the transitional one as soon as nothing depends on it anymore.

Because it decides that the grub-legacy package is unused and can be
removed despite the pin.  Whether this is the right thing is debatable;
I'm sure you find some bug reports about that if you dig into the long
list of aptitude bugs.
