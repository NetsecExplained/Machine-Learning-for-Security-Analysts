CNET: A note to our subscribers
July 17, 2002
Vol. 3, No. 17

Dear CatchUp newsletter subscribers:

Starting this week, we will be taking a break from our
regularly scheduled CatchUp newsletter--our apologies for any
inconvenience this may cause. However, have no fear, the
CatchUp database is still being updated, so run CatchUp now and
see what updates are waiting for you. As always, a hearty
thank-you for your continued support.

Cheers!

The CatchUp Team
