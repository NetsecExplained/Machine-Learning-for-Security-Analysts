Objective-C doesn't have class variables, but you can use C's static
variables in a similar way, since they're global within the scope of
the file in which they're defined. So, you need to define them in your
.m file (not as part of your class @interface), and keep in mind that
they won't be visible from category methods that are defined in a
different .m file.
