RE: Java is for kiddies
Misc rants about finding jobs, java vs C, what makes a good programmer, etc.


Okay, hmm, I thought twice about this, but what the hey, jobs are hard to
come by. There's a company hiring in Mountain View, looking for a few good
hackers, no Java, no GUI, not even C++ -- just C and Linux and networking
and good old stuff like that. They just raised a wad of money and they're
looking for a few "really good programmers", says the CTO. I know him --
very smart guy. Drives too fast, though, for what that's worth.

Joe Bob says "check it out". I'd be happy to pass on your resume, or you can
send it straight to them. Probably won't matter if I pass it on, since I
don't know you guys anyway...
