Since you seem fine with RAID 6, I'll assume you are also fine with RAID 5.

I don't know what your requirements / levels of paranoia are, but RAID 5 is=
=20
probably better than RAID 6 until you are up to 6 or 7 drives; the chance o=
f a=20
double failure in a 5 (or less) drive array is minuscule.

Modern mdadm can migrate from RAID 5 to RAID 6 when you add the 6th/7th dri=
ve=20
into the array.

Also modem mdadm has a wealth of RAID 1/0 features that may actually be a=20
better performance-wise than RAID 5 or RAID 6.

This one.

Sorry.

You can add the failed device back into the array and it will re-sync until=
=20
there is another issue with the device.  Just be sure to remember which dev=
ice=20
needs replacing for when your new HW arrives.
