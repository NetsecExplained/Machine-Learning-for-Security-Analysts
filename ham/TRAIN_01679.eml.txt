Rhapsody rules



I never thought Id say it, but Im changing my tune about subscription music services.

When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.coms Rhapsody, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now Im rethinking my stance.

Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, youll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you cant download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s? Let me know at edit@download.com

Here are some representative responses from last week's question on who should take the blame for Web sites not being compatible in every browser:
"Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience"
A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.

"There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?."
After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.

"The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser."
Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.

"As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does."
Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.

"Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified."
A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.
