SMTP-Error 451 while using smarthost for mail deliveryHello alltogether

Currently I am trying to set up a Debian Lenny Server, but I am stuck at
mail delivery. The server I am trying to set up, has no FQDN, so I used
my ISP-Mailserver as a smarthost (I enabled the proper SMTP
authentication in exim4).
This setup worked a few days, before I suddenly received 451 errors.
At first I thought it to be a problem with Exim4, so I switched to
postfix. But postfix also gives me the 451 error:

Apr 22 15:53:31 openshoolproxy postfix/smtp[24368]: 413CF26EF9:

relay=smtp.strato.com[81.169.145.132]:25, delay=2137,
delays=2136/0.05/0.33/0.12, dsn=4.0.0, status=deferred (host
smtp.strato.com[81.169.145.132] said: 451 Local Error (in reply to end
of DATA command))

To further troubleshoot my problem I used telnet to connect to
smtp.strato.com and to send a mail manually.

This is what I did:

telnet smtp.strato.de 25
Trying 81.169.145.133...

Very odd. After this fail I tried the same procedure from my arch linux
box at home. It succeeded:

This looks very strange to me. Independently from my mailserver the
telnet command should have succeeded on both machines. But it failed on
my debian box. What could be wrong? Is this a problem of my setup, or is
my ISP blocking something?

Thanks in advance

Benedikt
