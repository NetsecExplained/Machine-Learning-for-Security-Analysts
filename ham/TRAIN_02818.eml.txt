My Domain SMB knowledge is slightly rusty but here goes...

1. Your Samba server's ip address ends with a 0, which, AFAIK, is
reserved for network addresses (unless it has some special purpose
like the the /32 netmask). What is the output of "ifconfig -a"?

2. In your smb.conf:

2.a The following are missing (although they may be the default
settings for these variables):
security =3D user
local master =3D yes

2.b I have forgotten why, but AFAIK "127.0.0.1" should be listed in
"interfaces =3D".

2.c What does "share modes =3D No" do?

3. If you have not yet created a computer account for the Windows box,
you have to log on to the domain as root (or as a user with the right
to add a machine account) the first time that you do so from a Samba
client for the "add machine script =3D" variable to do its magic.

4. The "_ldap._tcp...." DNS SRV records are needed for an AD domain
(IIRC there are 6 +-1). I have never set up an AD Samba PDC but your
smb.conf settings look like those of an NT4 Samba PDC so it may just
be a misleading error/failure message. Your Windows box seems to be an
XP VM but just in case the netbios name is misleading, see
http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Windows7
