[SAtalk] help with postfix + spamassassinHi Folks,

I have just installed spamassassin 2.31 in my postfix MTA server.

At first, I would like to test it just in my email account before 
applying it to the wole site.

I configured just as in the INSTALL file:

	5. Create a .forward...
	"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #user"
	6. create a .procmailrc
	:0fw
	| /usr/bin/spamassassin -c 
			/etc/mail/spamassassin/rules

But the spams get trought it untouched. When I run it by the hand:

cat sample-spam.txt | /usr/bin/spamassassin -c 
				/etc/mail/spamassassin/rules

it does tag it as spam and send me the email.

what should I look at?

Thank you,
