As a user, I also prefer that approach, for all the reasons you mention.

You lost me, but I haven't delved into the aptitude source code.  My approa=
ch=20
would have been just making the 'hold' action also clear the 'automatically=
=20
installed' flag; essentially "institutionalizing" the temporary solution. =
=20
But, I defer to your solution as it sounds more flexible.

$(reportbug -k aptitude)
