Recommended values for JVMVersion ?There have been a number of releases since March 2009 so I'd like to =
know if the information on that page regarding the possible values of =
"JVMVersion" is still relevant:

=
http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Java/Reference/Java_I=
nfoplistRef/Articles/JavaDictionaryInfo.plistKeys.html

Especially the part where it is written that the "1.n*" values are not =
recommended.

Thanks in advance.
