The Java application loads the library, then calls a native function that spawns a new thread.  I attach this thread to the JVM (using AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon) and initialize a JNIEnv object.  I then use this JNIEnv object to get the Java class and a few methods (so I can get back to java on certain events).  When I run this over Java Web Start, the call that requests a method id crashes.  I have no idea why this happens, and can't find any related errors online.  Has anyone else run into this problem?  Any input would be appreciated.

I have a static initializer in that class, and that's where it is loading and calling that native method.  How can the class not be found if that's where the native method is being called from?

I'm not trying to load an instance of the class, I'm trying to load the 
actual class definition.  The error is telling me that the Java 
ClassLoader can't find that class on the classpath (at least that's my 
understanding).  What I don't understand is, for it to have called the 
static initializer, that means Java has already loaded the class 
definition, right?  So why can't it find it?
