If I understand correctly, you cannot find executable.
I encountered similar on my bsd box, when file changed
the name to firefox3. After a bit of climbing up and
falling down, the answer has shown.
If the question is: what is an alternative to firefox,
I could say: conkeror. Depends on libxul. Almost the
same look and feel, but no tables nor bars. I recompiled
from the source both lib and the browser. I assume for
debian already may be found the binary file.
If I missed the point, sorry.
