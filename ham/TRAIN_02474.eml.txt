Hi Andrew,

Thanks for jumping in here.  I've tried the following:

1. I have no ".xsession-errors" (or ".xession-errors") in my home 
directory or that of any other user.

2. It appears the configuration files for kde4 are found under 
"/usr/share/kde4/config" and also "/etc/kde4/kdm/".  I tried moving the 
"config" directory to an obscure location and the doing the "apt-get 
install --reinstall kdm".  It regenerated the config directory but no 
change in login.

3. I found that under /user/bin (when doing the dpkg -L kdm) there is a 
file "genkdmconf" which looked promising.  Reading the help file for it 
and executing "genkdmconf -no-old", the files under /etc/kde4/kdm were 
backed up and new ones regenerated.  Now, I get a different login screen 
background, but the action is still the same -- does not accept my 
password.  I can still use the "console login" option of that screen and 
get to the CLI login and doing so still allows me to startx and get 
things going.

So it appears that your last paragraph applies.  I'll be glad to try 
(almost) anything you or anyone else suggests on this.

(I am also, per my previous message, starting another thread for the 
symbol not found problem I have in trying to get some applications 
running (synaptic, iceape, geany to name a few).)

Regards,
Don
