Note that many Debian KDE 3.5 installations include both QT3 and QT4,
e.g. to support kdebluetooth or lsb-desktop.

If you upgrade your RAM from 1GB to 2GB, KDE 4 feels about as fast
as KDE 3.5, except KDE 4 startup and KMail startup are still slower.

One reason for needing additional RAM seems to be memory leaks,
although whether in QT4 or KDE itself I don't know.
