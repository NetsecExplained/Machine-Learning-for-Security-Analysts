Hi Camale=C3=B3n,

In English the slash is understood to mean "or".  There is no limit of
32000 files or folders under a folder in ext3.

There is a limit of 31998 directories under a directory.  This is caused by
the ext3 hard link count limit being 32000.  Two links are needed for the
parent directory entry and the current directory's ".", leaving only
31998 links available for ".." links from subdirectories.

This limit is rarely encountered in practice because it is so much more
efficient to use multiple directory levels, e.g.:

parent-
  a-
    able
    alf
  b-
    beta
    bravo
