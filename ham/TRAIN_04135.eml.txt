 from the Hard Disk Upgrade Mini HOWTO :

8. Prepare LILO to boot the new disk

   (Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this.)

   We're  assuming  that LILO is installed on the hard disk's Master Boot
   Record (MBR); this seems to be the most common configuration. You want
   to  install  LILO  on  what's  presently the second hard disk but will
   become the first hard disk.

   Edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follows:

        disk=/dev/hdb bios=0x80       # Tell LILO to treat the second
                                      # disk as if it were the first
                                      # disk (BIOS ID 0x80).
        boot=/dev/hdb                 # Install LILO on second hard
                                      # disk.
        map=/new-disk/boot/map        # Location of "map file".
        install=/new-disk/boot/boot.b # File to copy to hard disk's
                                      # boot sector.
        prompt                        # Have LILO show "LILO boot:"
                                      # prompt.
        timeout=50                    # Boot default system after 5
                                      # seconds. (Value is in tenths of
                                      # seconds.)
        image=/new-disk/boot/vmlinuz  # Location of Linux kernel. The
                                      # actual name may include a version
                                      # number, for example
                                      # "vmlinuz-2.0.35".
            label=linux               # Label for Linux system.
            root=/dev/hda1            # Location of root partition on
                                      # new hard disk. Modify this as
                                      # appropriate for your system.
                                      # Note that you must use the name
                                      # of the future location, once the
                                      # old disk has been removed.
            read-only                 # Mount partition read-only at
                                      # first, to run fsck.

PS.  Um, what does

do?
