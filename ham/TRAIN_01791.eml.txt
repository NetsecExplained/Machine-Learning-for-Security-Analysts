Thanks for the confirmation, Diederik.  I wonder which package to file a
bug report against?  The k3b package may in fact be easiest to request
that the sound files be packaged in .ogg format, but that only masks
that fact that something in the KDE sound stack is having an issue with
.wav files.

My system is configured to use the Phonon Xine Backend in Sound and Video 
Configuration.  Could that be the culprit and how can we test?
