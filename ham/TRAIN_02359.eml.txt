Resources for learning LinuxFrom nobody Sun Sep 18 20:45:30 2016

Hello,

I've been using linux (debian) for about a year now, and although I'm no
longer scared of the command line I would like to do a little
reading/studying of linux to get a better understanding of some of the more
advanced topics, or to see if I have learned a lot of the things that might
be taught in a university-linux/UNIX course. I'm sure that there is a lot of
stuff that I've missed by just going at it with trial and error. Perhaps
there are some online courses posted to youtube, or a few books that someone
might like to recommend? I would be interested to know what types of things
one must learn to get "linux-certification" (I presume there is such a
thing).

Regards,
James
