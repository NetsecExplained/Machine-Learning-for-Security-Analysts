  Watch out for permissions -- /tmp is "1777" (rwxrwxrwt), it has to
be world-writable and have the sticky bit set, which ensures that only
users who create files in there can write to them.  Permissions come
from the mounted FS, not the mount point, so make sure you set these
permissions while it's mounted.

  Because of the world-writability, security conscious admins mount
it nodev and nosuid.  If you're more careful, you can mount it noexec,
too, but that will break some third-party software installers that
work by examining your system, writing a custom config script inside
/tmp somewhere, and then running it.

  So your fstab entry might look like:

> /dev/with/temp/ /tmp ext3 nosuid,nodev 0 2

  Not that I recall.

  Setting /tmp to non-executable by the noexec mount option does break 
things, but as I said above, my recollection is that it mostly breaks 
third-party stuff.  I think the apt scripts are all in /var/lib/dkpg/info,
and are run from there.
  Setting the *directory* noexec seems very bad, since the exec bit
on directories controls the ability to cd to it, and turning that
off would make it largely useless. 

  As to "why", on moderately-high-availability multi-user systems, I 
often put /tmp on a separate partition precisely so I can use mount
options to globally control access.  This is more important in a 
truly multi-user system than a home system, of course.

  Misbehaving apps rarely but sometimes blow the lid off of /tmp, and
having it be on its own partition means this doesn't compromise the
system as a whole, and you can easily figure out what's going on by 
seeing the logged errors and looking at "df" output.  Some folks keep
/var/log on a separate partition for similar reasons.

  Again, all of this is more important in a multi-user production 
environment.  On my home systems, I mostly don't worry about this
sort of thing.
