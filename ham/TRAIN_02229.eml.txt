By far the coolest solution to this would be to "fix" php :)
Take a look at main/php_variables.c in the php source distribution.
You could mess around with the variable is_array in
php_register_variable_ex() and see if you can force all variables to be
arrays :) As far as I can tell the reason they do this is to save
time by not having to work out which variables have multiple values.
