The kernel from lenny-backports, testing, or sid will probably be using the=
=20
same device naming as Ubuntu.

Likely it is not using UUIDs trying to be compatible with initramfs-es or=20
other systems that don't like them.  But, as you've seen, using the "raw"=20
device name doesn't really help either.  Different kernel versions, and eve=
n=20
kernels compiled with different options, will use different "raw" names for=
=20
the devices.  In odd setups, the device name might change from boot to boot=
 as=20
devices are (now) discovered asynchronously so they may be assigned names i=
n a=20
different order based how quickly they respond to the kernel.
