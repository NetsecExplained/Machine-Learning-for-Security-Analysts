I'd had similar problem with Iceweasel on Lenny when my browser cache
limit was set to a large value.  But things are okay after bringing it
down (to 20MB).  You might want to try that.

Large cache slows Iceweasel down because it uses these large databases
of stored history to suggest addresses in each tab's address bar.  I
also had a Zotero database, which used to worsen things.

Girish.
