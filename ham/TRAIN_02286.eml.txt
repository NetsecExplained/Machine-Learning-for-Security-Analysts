Debian users deserve quality packaging of upstream software, good integrati=

eat their kittens (yet data loss bugs happen). But whether upstream softwar=

Move on. kdepim 4.3 is gone. Given that KDE SC 4.5 might release with kdepi=
m=20
from 4.4 anyway extending kdepim 4.4 codebase lifetime to 1 year, beating d=
ead=20
horse (4.3) makes absolutely no sense. I recommend you to face reality here.

Don't you see that you always put yourself in the front in your rationales?=

YOU run a dozen of DB servers, YOU don't want another one, YOU don't trust=
