default setting just de facto be that? Is there any way to provide 3rd =
party access to java preferences settings?

I wouldn't suggest putting any time into engineering a Java-specific =
switch which is only going to be used by an audience of developers, who =
can follow steps on a wiki until Mozilla is ready to make the switch for =
all of their customers. I think the plan is to just cut over completely =
to Plugin2 and drop support for the JEP at some point (and we had to =
ship Update 2 & 7 with the Plugin2 symlink present in /Library/Internet =
Plug-Ins to make that a possibility). But really someone from Mozilla =
would be best to comment on how and when they are planning to do what.

I don't believe it makes sense for Apple to say which plugin "should be =
the default for all browsers". Plugin1 is simply the default for Safari =
for now (and will likely remain the default forever on Leopard). Chrome =
never bothered to implement a compatibility hack to load Plugin1, and =
simply did without Java support until Apple shipped an NPAPI Plugin2 =
that could render cooperatively via CoreGraphics, and didn't use an =
overlay window.

Obviously, Plugin2 is a continuing work in progress that has several =
more technical challenges ahead (like interleaving hardware accelerated =
drawing), will likely require changes to browsers (like adopting =
CoreAnimation-NPAPI drawing model), 3rd party libraries (like JOGL), and =
will probably provide a tiered user experience based on which browser =
supports which drawing models, event models, and other features. We are =
also still iterating on the user experience of how to handle applets =
that open their own windows and dialogs that are in a different process =
from the browser.

Currently, we don't have any stored setting which tracks the switch =
between Plugin1 or Plugin2. The state of the Java Preferences UI is =
actually just built from the presence or non-presence of the =
JavaPluginCocoa.bundle symlink. In a future release when we make Plugin2 =
the default for Safari, we'll simply delete the JavaPluginCocoa.bundle =
in /Library/Internet Plug-ins (which we know Mozilla does not use), and =
alter Java Preferences to write out a symlink to ~/Library/Internet =
Plug-ins instead, so the change is only scoped to the user. At least =
that's the current plan, and it could change, but it's the best idea =
we've got so far.

I hope this provides some perspective on where we'd like to go with =
Plugin2,
