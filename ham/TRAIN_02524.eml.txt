OK, gotcha.

I don't think you can do that with exmh, but you can do it on the
command line, if you use sh or ksh:

	for f in `folders -fast -r`
	do
		echo sorting $f ...
		sortm +$f
	done

It could take a long time.

At work, I have to use Outlook.  Ick.  I hate it.  But it does a few
things right.  Like making indices for each folder, and not just by
date, but also by sender, message size, subject.  So I can sort by any
column instantly.

I believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,
provided the IMAP server makes such indices.

I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,
and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow
link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers.  I am just scared to move.  I've been
using MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long
time!
