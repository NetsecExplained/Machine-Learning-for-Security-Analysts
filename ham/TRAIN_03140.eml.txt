It seems that several people are missing the point that this is NOT an image
database.  It is high-resolution topological data rendered in three
dimensions.  Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people
navigate familiar terrain visually.  In other words, it is not intended as a
wannabe spy satellite.  Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model
of the earth's surface.  When a particular region in question is covered in
a city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the
earth's surface.  The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all
sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data.

Got it?
