Put the commands in .gnomerc (for GNOME only) or .xsessionrc (for all X
sessions). If you want to start graphical applications, put the
appropriate .desktop files in ~/.config/autostart, or use the GNOME
session manager for the purpose. As others have pointed out, the file
.xsession should be reserved for starting an X session.
