Any updated information to "FileID race detected" email thread?Hello:

I=92ve recently had a few users get new Snow Leopard machines.  They all =
are having problems similar to those described in the =93FileID race =
detected=94 (Jan 19, 2010) of this list.  I share home directories using =
NFS (Mac OS X Server 10.5.8).  My Leopard clients do not exhibit this =
behavior.

The Snow Leopard clients are all patched up to 10.6.3.  I searched this =
list and did not see any information indicating that this bug, alluded =
to by Jim Luther (response to initial =93FileID race detected=94 posting =
also on Jan 19, 2010), has been fixed by now.  Does anyone have some =
concrete information about this bug?  Thanks a bunch for your help.
