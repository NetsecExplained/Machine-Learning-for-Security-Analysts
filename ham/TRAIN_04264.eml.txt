I prefer Debian because more packages are well-maintained under main.  Ubun=

provides good support for universe, I guess.  But, the fact that Ubuntu fee=

those packages need to be separated just demonstrates that they are "second-

Ubuntu shares with Debian to be enough of an advantage to put it above othe=

solutions like RHEL or SLE(D/S).
