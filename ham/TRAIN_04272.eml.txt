VLC will lag when reading local videos, whatever the codec-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

When watching videos locally, with VLC, it often lags at some parts of
the videos, and the following kinds of messages are displayed at the
console:

==
[some time] main video output error: picture [hexadecimal ref.] refcount is -1
overflow in spectral RLE, ignoring
==

The [some time] references are often ~40 times separated, i.e. I could
get

==
[00000010] main video output error: picture [hexadecimal ref.] refcount is -1
[00000050] main video output error: picture [hexadecimal ref.] refcount is -1
.
.
.
==

It does not only happen with Матрёшка files (.mkv). (I here
test if Gnus supports cyrillic out-of-the-box.)

Is it normal? Does it happen often with videos? What would it be due
to? Are they corrupted?

Thanks.
