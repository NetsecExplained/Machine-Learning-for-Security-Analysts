There is no guarantee that (void*) is the same size as *any* of the
standard integer types.

That, in no way, means that (long) cannot be larger than (void*). That
said, I do believe that the intent is that all of the standard integer
types can be assumed to be zero when returned from a message sent to
nil, even if the wording leaves the potential for a gap on unusual
architectures (such as where long is larger than void*).
