Parted is your friend! You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being
that you can't move the start of a partition, but it's quite powerful
nevertheless, and I've been very happy with it the few times I've had to
use it.

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand
edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating "/", put your /home/ files
back into place and you're ready to go.
That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
parameters to save (I have to pass "pci=bios,biosirq" for one of my
computers to work for example).

HTH,
