I'm not really sure if this is guarateed to work on all Java =
implementations, but you could try to open the file for random access =
(http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/RandomAccessFile.html), =
then write random data to the entire contents of the file before you =
delete. It might even work if you first open, then delete, before =
writing random data if you prefer that.=20

But it might be that you are better off finding a command-line tool that =
handles the secure deletion for you, and create a Swing app that =
delegates the heavy lifting to the command-line tool. Low-level file =
system access isn't really one of Java's strong points, as its foucs has =
always been being cross-platform (Java 7's NIO.2 functionality might fix =
some of these issues though) .
