Just for the record, I am experiencing similar problems: X (or KDE) becomin=

almost unusably slow. FWIW, I have a Lenovo Z61m with a Radeon Mobility X14=

chipset.

When I'm just working on the notebook display, everything is fine usually, =

when I connect a separate display, performance decreases a lot.

Suspend works fine for me, though. With 4.4.2, I even get a nice notificati=

that the display settings have changed afer having plugged the notebook in =
