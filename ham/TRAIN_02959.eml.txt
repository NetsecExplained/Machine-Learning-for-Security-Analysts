Off the top of my head:

Safari will pickup Plugin2 if Plugin1 is not present - which Java =
Preferences toggles
Chrome picks up Plugin2 only
Firefox is hardwired to Plugin1 with the JEP/MRJ, unless you remove it =
them from (app)/Contents/MacOS/plugins
Camino is also hardwired with the JEP/MRJ, but does not pick up Plugin2 =
if they are disabled (not sure why)
Opera seems to always die on launch for me
