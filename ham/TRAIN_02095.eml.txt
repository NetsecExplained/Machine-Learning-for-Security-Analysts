This is exactly the problem I saw when I updated X11 to 2.5.0 (mouse 
button 2 sends Leave/Notify instead of ButtonPress or ButtonRelease), and 
as a matter of fact I went so far as to open a ticket on it.  It was 
marked invalid a short while later when I reported that the problem went 
away with a reboot.



Since that ticket was closed, I have seen the same problem on a second 
system running 10.5.8 (a PowerBook G4 15").  A reboot also solved the 
problem on the second system.  Unfortunately I haven't seen the problem 
appear again on either of my two systems, so I can't offer any help in 
root causing it.
