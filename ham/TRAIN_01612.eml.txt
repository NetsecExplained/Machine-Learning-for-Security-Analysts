Re: 2.5.0 weirdnessIf there is something new to 2.5.0, then it is a different issue.  The =
issue as described in bug #58 is known, and the problem certainly lies =
outside of X11.  I am suspicious of claims that something "new" in this =
regard has cropped up in 2.5.0 since the code in question has remained =
pretty much unchanged for well over a year now.
