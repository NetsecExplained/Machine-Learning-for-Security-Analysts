The KResource API is public API of KDE4, it can at best removed at the firs=
t=20
KDE5 version (which is probably still several years away).
Some of its plugins are public API as well (those from kdepimlibs) so they=

stay too.
Problematic are plugins from kdepim, they can be replaced by respective=20
Akonadi base resource implementations.

Right, I think it will run if it does not find its configuration, thus not=

knowing whether it has already run.
Could lead to duplicated resources on Akonadi side though (if it has been r=
un=20
before).
