As I understand it, both Network Manager and Wicd are intended to
control the network interfaces.  If you want to control the interfaces
manually, remove NM.  If you want to use NM then only the loopback
interface should be defined in /etc/network/interface.  

NM works very well for me on my Ubuntu Lucid laptop.  Meanwhile, my
Debian desktop utilizes /etc/network/interface as it doesn't roam
anywhere.
