rpm-zzzlist@freshrpms.net
Thanks for the great work Mathias but I would like to point out that this
list is fastly become the apt-rpm-list instead of the rpm-list. The
discussion concerning apt is overwhelming. Maybe another list is in order
for those having trouble with apt-rpm. apt-rpm-hotline@freshrpms.net ? :)

Though I think apt-rpm is a great tool, I don't use it and would like to
get back to talk of new packages and rpm building techniques.
