I had this problem with 64-bit Ubuntu for a long time. Finally, when
Adobe was working on the 9.x release I inquired directly to Adobe. The
result was that I became a beta tester. And the outcome was that Adobe
fixed Reader 9.1 so that I could see my printers.

I have not had the problem since. I suggest getting the latest version
of Reader. Version 8.1.7 is really old anyway.
