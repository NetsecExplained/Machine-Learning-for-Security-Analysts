Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now
e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give
it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
Outlook.

When we get more (good) "nice" tests, the GA will assign lower
scores to them.  I think the current problem is that there are
very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots
of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big
problem to solve.
