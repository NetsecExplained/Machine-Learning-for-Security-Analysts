aptitude stuckToday's run of 'aptitude -s safe-upgrade' had been running for over an
hour and was using half my memory when I killed it. The status line was:

open: 107756; closed: 119093; defer: 107181; conflict: 167

There's evidently some situation it can't resolve. How can I figure out
what package(s) cause the problem?
