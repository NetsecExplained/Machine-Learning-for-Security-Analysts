I see your point.  I'll try to give more details next time.

OK, I'll tell you what.  Since I know that a newer version which fixes
at least one bug I'm experiencing is waiting in the wings in Sid,
and since Squeeze hasn't frozen yet, I'll wait until the new version
migrates to Squeeze.  (Let's hope that Squeeze doesn't freeze first.)
And then I'll try again.  And if I still get the same error, I'll
at least *try* to come up with a test case.
