Simple answer:

http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/asterisk/1:1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny1

So they are mostly bristuff. However they include other fixes (including
some fixes that were never accepted by Junghanns due to bad
communication).

There are some other changes apart from the bristuff fixes and we can't
simply call it "bristuffed".
