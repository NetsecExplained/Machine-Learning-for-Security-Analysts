They know bull semen, and the burger you ate at lunch may have had its 
sire's contribution to its genetics purchased through them.

My ex-wife worked in their lab for a year while I was in gradual school. 
We had boxes of masking tape from ABS pre-printed with the names and 
serial numbers of 'decomissioned' bulls.

They are also known for the hideous puns on their sign just outside of 
Madison on I90/94. But the puns haven't been any good since the secretary 
who first wrote them retired.
