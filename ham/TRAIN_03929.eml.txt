[SAdev] [Bug 839] mailbox corruption not fixed with procmail 3.22http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=839

I haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires File::Spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it.  I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's
because I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  The perl @ stuff
was bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...
