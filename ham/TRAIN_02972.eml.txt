Yup. I do agree here, however, e.g., the Cocoa(Touch) Framework already =
requires "no blocking, all user interface operation on the main thread". =
If Apple then says: "all your Bluetooth communication has to be on the =
main thread, too", it does not restrict the rules set up by the Cocoa =
Framework any further. So, if rules for apps are already set by the OS, =
your library would not restrict anything by saying it must be started =
from the main loop and the main loop cannot block.

Are you asking about BTstack? If yes: the BTstack client  library does =
not provide a way to choose a run loop, but as it is only using =
thread-safe socket functions, that could run on any given thread. If =
there is a clear need for such a feature, I would't mind adding a "set =
default runloop" function. Would that help you in any way?
