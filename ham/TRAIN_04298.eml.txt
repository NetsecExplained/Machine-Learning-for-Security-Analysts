I'd just like to recommend the newest Viz to ukers just for the hilarious "David 
Blaine: Stalag Magician".  The ego'd one is in a WWII prison camp and sort of 
trying to escape.  Several times he seems to have escaped and the british 
officers celebrate before it's revealed he's been buried alive or hiding in a 
freezer.  At one point he's asked why and says "Well it's not for publicity" 
Cracking stuff.
