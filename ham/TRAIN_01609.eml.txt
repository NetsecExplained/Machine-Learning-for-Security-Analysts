Can someone please tell me what a "pitch" constitutes? I have an idea 
it is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim, but this sounds 
more formal.

Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his
sculptures.
Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
there.
So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.
(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.
