Re: [Razor-users] Problem with Razor 2.14 and Spamassassin 2.41This is due to insufficient write privileges to the "razor-agent.log" 
file. A quick work-around is to do a "chmod go+rx" on that file (of 
course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible).

In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't 
have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later 
in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the "unblessed" 
error.

Hope this helps,
Michael Duff
