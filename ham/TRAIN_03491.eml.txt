Yes, I am sure of that.
I printed all the steps on the output to check:

# Create stream=20
## Schedule stream=20
### Start stream=20
[stuff happens]
#### Stop stream=20
##### Invalidate stream=20
###### Release stream=20
# Create stream=20
## Schedule stream=20
### Start stream=20
[...]
#### Stop stream=20
##### Invalidate stream=20
###### Release stream=20

I don't unschedule the stream from the run loop since I invalidate it.

All the stream related stuff is happening on the same thread (at least for =
now).
Plus, in my example, I don't create a new stream after deleting the first o=
ne (since I have nothing left to watch).

It seems to me the stream may not be properly closed, or it is trying to ac=
cess something that doesn't exist anymore.
But I am following all the steps for properly stopping and releasing the st=
ream.
