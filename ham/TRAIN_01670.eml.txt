I believe that's just a matter of string parsing. If someone were to fix
the openssh package, removing the explicit Requires:, I believe the
automagic binary handler would figure the right libraries to use and
install. I haven't met an openssh like that and in worst case I've had 3
different openssl libraries (WTF can't they just bump a major version if
it's incompatible?!?).

I have a few such things (with jdk, imlib, kernel DRI version..
something) and Ive just made dummy packages (with verbose warning
attached ;) that explicitly provide those capabilities. (or claim to,
that is).
