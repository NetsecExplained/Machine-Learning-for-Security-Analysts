Hi Goran,

I just posted a followup with my complaint on the mc user list:
http://mail.gnome.org/archives/mc/2010-April/msg00024.html

It's not that simple as I mention there: when you change that default 
option all the directory entries turn bright white and in mcedit the 
entries turn black on white with a blue background which looks ridiculous.

The problem is that they changed a major function without fallback and 
without a spectrum of options.

Too bad but it's waiting until skins get developed or pinning mc to 
prevent 4.7.0.1 from installing.
