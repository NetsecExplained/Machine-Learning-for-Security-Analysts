Re: Nil messaging statement in "Cocoa Fundimentals Guide"

I am not quite sure what's an "appropriate negative literal" and whether =
it's present or absent, but perhaps it's just that there's a fine point =
there which escapes me (I do admit I did not check the doc, it might use =
the term before in a way which makes the statement unambiguous).

What's -- IMHO of course -- pretty misleading is what follows though. =
Seems to me we are checking the word object variable very very =
explicitly -- you can't be much more explicit in testing XXX than =
writing "while (XXX)".

What we are -- in fact -- testing _implicitly_ is whether the _enm_ =
object variable might contain nil.

Or do implicit/explicit mean something else in English than in all other =
languages I bumped into?

Best,
