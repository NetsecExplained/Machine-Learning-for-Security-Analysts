It's available in Sid:

http://packages.debian.org/sid/ipwatchd-gnotify

But, are you sure you want such a solution for your Xen doms? :-? 

That tool seems to be focused for desktop users and just for alerting 
purposes, I mean, what is intended to do when it detects a IP conflict?

You can use a network scanner (nmap, arp-scan, netdiscover...) to prevent 
assigning a duplicate IP address to the hosts but I'm not sure this is 
your goal.
