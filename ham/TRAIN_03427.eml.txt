do you mean to set a shell environment variable

This still gives me the  heinous error:

X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for =
operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  147 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)
  Serial number of failed request:  19
  Current serial number in output stream:  21


My remote linux machine is running CentOS 5.4 with everything up-to-date =
via yum. Would you recommend filing a bug report with the developers of =
mesa and hope that some day it trickles down to RHEL and then to CentOS? =
Or should I build my own mesa? And just to clarify, this is NOT an X11 =
problem right?

Thanks,
