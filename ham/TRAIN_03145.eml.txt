Yes, I'm saying that if he extends "genetic engineering" to include
selecting animals to breed, he must extend it to include selecting
people to breed with.

I'm saying that my parents selected each other, and that they did so
because (among other reasons) each wanted the other's genes to be
mixed with their own in the offspring that they were planning.

What does it matter that they were selecting to produce their own
offspring, rather than the offspring of two unrelated animals?
