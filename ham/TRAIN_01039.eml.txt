Actually, the problem is that nobody cares enough about KDE 3.5 to
actually do anything about it.  Yes, fine, there's trinity, but as far
as anybody can tell, that's just one guy.  I'm sure you could find one
guy somewhere out there still hacking on Linux 2.2 or something equally
dead.  Doesn't make it any less dead.

YES, you can have KDE 3.5!  You can even have it as an official part of
Debian!  Nobody will stop you!  However,  you will need to do some work.
You will need to make sure that there is sufficient upstream developer
committment to keep it usable and current, and you will need to make
sure there is a sufficiently motivated packaging team to keep up with
upstream work, triage bugs, and cooridinate package updates with
upstream, the the release teams, the security team, etc etc.  Can you do
that?

noah
